<p>Saturday morning the girls got up at 6:30. The latest they sleep is around 7:00- 7:30. So you can see why I put sleep in past 8 a.m. would be such a big deal. But this past Saturday, Nate took the girls downstairs so I could sleep in. It was so nice. But then later that night was the end of Daylight Savings so we moved our clocks back an hour and stayed up later playing games with friends. However, the girls did not adjust to the new time and Lai Lai was up at 5:15 a.m. Nice. She still haven't adjusted to the new time yet. I'll have to keep her up one night so she can get the times right.		</p>

<p>Took this adorable little girl to the pediatrician for her check up yesterday and she weighed in at 10 pounds 12 ounces at three weeks old. Good to know that I'm feeding her well.</p>
<p>So, I am finally producing enough milk to feed her solely on nursing. Yay. No more supplementing and pumping and nursing that took an hour to do. Now we can just nurse and be done. I am so grateful that the prescription worked and was able to increase my milk supply. Phew.</p>
<p>Her blocked tear duct is getting better. It is still blocked, but the pediatrician told me I can massage it to help unblock it. It's not as gooey as before. Thank goodness.</p>
<p>And she is on a pretty good feeding schedule. And now that I'm only nursing it only takes 30 minutes to feed her. I am now working on getting her to napâ€¦ on her own. That's the hard part. I did the Babywise technique on the other two girls and got them to sleep through the night at 3-3 1/2 months. I remember what a challenge it was to let them cry themselves to sleep. But now that I am actually doing it again with a newborn, it's even more challenging than I remembered it. This little girl just won't give up. She can cry for a long time. And I hate listening to her cry. Boo hoo. I need a mom support group for this. I just have to remember that the pediatrician said it was a good thing I'm teaching her to sleep without nursing to sleep. And it's for her own good. It will make life easier for all of us in the long run. For now, it's rough on all of us.		</p>

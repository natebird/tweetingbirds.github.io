				Christmas Eve Nate and I set up for the big day. We hid the presents until Christmas Eve so the kids don't mess with it or count how many gifts they are getting and such. Nate was watching Christmas Vacation while putting out the gifts.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8086" alt="131224_00046" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131224_00046.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8087" alt="131224_00047" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131224_00047.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>

<p>Christmas morning the girls got up around 7:30 and we made our annual phone call to Nate's twin brothers on the West coast which was about 4:45 their time when we called and woke them up. They are the girls' favorite uncles. So they love to call them and say, "Wakey, wakey!!" And the funny thing is they answer every time.</p>

<p>The girls were eager to get downstairs to see what's down there. This year we kept it simple and didn't really get them anything big. They got a little random gifts here and there. I didn't really get them a whole lot of toys because I'm tired of picking up toys and trying to get them to pick up toys.</p>

<p>And Santa brought Lai Lai a magnetic drawing pad in her favorite color.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8098" alt="131225_00058" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131225_00058.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>

<p>Each girl also got books because I like them to read. And Lai Lai got a bunch of Minnie Mouse things, her favorite this year. And each girl also got a game because we like to play games as a family.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8100" alt="131225_00060" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131225_00060.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>Kenzie got a few American girl doll craft kits and some toys for Kit. Each girl also got Disney pajamas and a Disney fleece blanket with their name embroidered on it. Got them for a steal on Disney's online store.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8101" alt="131225_00061" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131225_00061.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>Lai Lai got her own Leapster Explorer game system just like her sisters'.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8102" alt="131225_00062" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131225_00062.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>Laney got the art fashion kit and some Lego kits. We also got each girl a case for their Leapster Explorer and a game.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8103" alt="131225_00063" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131225_00063.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p>This year I got Nate a game, 7 Wonders. I get him a game every year. And I also surprised him with a couple Sonos speakers. I love surprising him every year.</p>

<p>And the day after Christmas I started taking down all the Christmas decorations. It was pretty much all put away by the second day. I was ready for it to all come down and put everything back to normal.</p>

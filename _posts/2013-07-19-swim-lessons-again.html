				So the two older girls had swim lessons last summer and didn't learn to swim. We are trying again this year. This time we are doing it with a different place and teachers. The aquatic center opened up this year and they were offering swim lessons for much cheaper than anywhere else. I thought we would try it since the class sizes were also small too. We ended up putting the girls in level 1-3 classes. The girls loved it. After each class Laney would say, "That was awesome!" Kenzie loved it too. Much different than swim lessons from last year. Both girls are doing much better with swim too. Kenzie loves to put her head in the water now. She can swim a distance and can float front and back. They started level 3 yesterday and goes until right before school starts. The girls loved their instructors and this new way of learning swim. I would love for them to keep swimming more. I would love for them to be on a swim team or something, but I don't think now is the time for them to start that. The girls would also like to play tennis. We definitely couldn't do all that. So for now they will just keep with dance because they still love dance and Kenzie will start piano in August. </p>

				I called my mom yesterday to check up on how she is doing since her overnight hospital radiation treatment on Monday and Tuesday. Being my mom, without a second to spare for resting, she was at Hobby Lobby shopping. I'm sure her doctors would be happy to hear that.</p>
<p>Anyway, I had my mom on speaker on my cell phone. Once Kenzie heard her voice, this was the dialog that occurred.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> [grabbing the phone away from me] Let me hold that, mom.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> [putting the phone to her ear] Hello? Hi, Puo Puo.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My mom:</span> Hi, Wei Wei (what my parents call her). How are you doing today?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> I'm doing good.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My mom:</span> What are you doing?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> [both of us sitting on her blanket] We are on the magic carpet.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My mom:</span> Where are you going?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> We are flying to Jasmine's castle.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My mom: </span>What are you going to do there?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> We are going to see the snowman.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> Tell Puo Puo what you did with the scissor today.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> I can cut paper all by myself with the scissor.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">My mom:</span>  Wow! You are such a big girl. Did you cut your finger and get an aw-oo (what my mom calls an ouwie)?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> No, I only have one aw-oo on my knee.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> [getting the Winnie the Pooh book of the shelf] Puo Puo, I'll read you a story about Winnie the Pooh.</p>
<p>Then she went into "reading" the book, meaning she recited what she remember from us reading to her and what the pictures show. She is getting pretty good at talking on the phone.		</p>

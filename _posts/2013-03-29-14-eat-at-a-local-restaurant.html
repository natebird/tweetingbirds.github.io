				There are tons of yummy local restaurants I haven't tried and I have lived here for 7 years now. And I love to try new foods so I put this on my list. To me, a local restaurant means there is only one of it. Nothing of the same somewhere else, even if it's still only in Georgia. The one I did was Tea Leaves and Thyme. It's a English tea restaurant. I took the two older girls there for Laney's birthday celebration. We didn't throw her a party this year because we did one last year. Instead, I surprised her with a tea party with just the three of us. We actually went earlier in the day on the Saturday before Laney's birthday. But it turned out that you needed to make reservations for that place. They do walk-ins, but on Saturdays they are pretty busy and we went around lunch time. The girls were pretty disappointed. As I called Nate to tell him what happened, he said to make a reservation for later that afternoon. I did and we went back after taking Laney to a friends' birthday party.</p>
<p>I thought it was pretty fun. Kenzie also enjoyed it. Laney didn't care for it as much. She tried her pink tea (strawberry kiwi non-cafenated tea) but not really a tea person. She liked the dress up part where they had clothes, hats and some accessories for dress up. They sang happy birthday to her and brought out a brownie treat for her and a candle to blow out. They had a little happy birthday name card at the table for her. She liked that. Other than that she didn't eat much of anything else. She did eat some scones. Kenzie tried a bunch of things. Luckily I just had the girls split a kid platter and I had one. I liked mine. I also tried the vanilla tea that was also non-cafenated. I am not usually a tea person but it wasn't bad after adding a couple cubes of sugar in it. I would go back, just probably not with kids next time. I think I'll take my mom or go with girlfriends.</p>

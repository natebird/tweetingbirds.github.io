				Kenzie learned how to kick yesterday. She actually learned the word last Saturday at the Chinese New Year Festival as she saw kids do karate as they kicked in the air and jumped around. Since then, she has wanted to kick her ball. At first she was a little hesitant to kick while standing up. So she sat down and kicked the ball. She is a very careful child. She is very cautious when going up and down the stairs. She gets on all fours to go up a ledge, doesn't matter if it's only an inch above ground. But I worked with her yesterday and helped her to kick standing up.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Rh9wScT5I/AAAAAAAABV4/zqYhDDcY7vI/s1600-h/IMG_7329.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7329.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5166862386062970770" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Rh-AScT6I/AAAAAAAABWA/NxDaQ8-xrk0/s1600-h/IMG_7327.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7327.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5166862390357938082" /></a>		</p>

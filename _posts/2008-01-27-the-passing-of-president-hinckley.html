Hinckley, the prophet of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, passed away tonight (Sunday). He became the prophet when I was 12 years old, and he has been the most influential prophet in my life thus far. I remember several talks he gave as it has changed my life. He has done so much for the church since he worked pretty much his whole life there. I was able to have the chance to see him speak and also to see him at the Tabernacle on Temple Square for a few church events. The spirit was always really strong in his presence. I am glad his has returned to his family in heaven and to be reunited with is wife, Marjorie Pay Hinckley. My prayers go out to his family as they go through this time of loss.		</p>

				Life has been busy here since I only have three more weeks until my due date. I put off all baby preparation until after the New Year. Now that we're into the New Year, I'm still procrastinating it a bit as I try to get the house orderly, plan some YW stuff for when I'm gone, getting Nate back into school, and try to overcome this 2-week cough/sinus infection/pink eye.</p>
<p>I went in for my weekly OB check-up and I have started to dilate, 1 cm, almost 2. It doesn't say much though since with Kenzie, I was dilated to a 4.5 cm before I even went into the hospital. Not really helping me with my procrastination since my hospital bag is still not packed.</p>
<p>Oh well, at least I started thinking about baby stuff and made a list. That's a step forward. And I had Nate bring down a small luggage, the infant car seat, the swing, and baby tub from the attic. None of it is set up, just stashed in the guest room for now until I find a place to put everything, including the bassinet.</p>
<p>But the main distraction from baby preparation is my new obsessionâ€¦ see next post.		</p>

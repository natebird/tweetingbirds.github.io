				I'm so glad Kenzie had a wonderful year of kindergarten. She had an amazing teacher and para-pro who worked so well with her. She learned so much from her teachers. And her school was just awesome too. She made some fun friends at school. And I was able to get to know her friends at school and some of her friends' parents since I was the room mom. I enjoyed being involved in her learning process and getting to know her teacher too.</p>
<p>Kenzie received the Creative Writer award. She is really imaginative with her writing. And I also made a photo slideshow that they watched at awards day then we burned on to DVD for each child in the class. Then for her teacher's end of the year gift, I made a photo book of the entire class at Shutterfly that included pictures of each child and highlights of this year. Then on the last page of the book I left blank for Kenzie to write a thank you note to her teacher. I was lucky enough to have been there for a lot of the class events with my camera so I could take pictures of things.</p>

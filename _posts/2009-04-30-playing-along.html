				In her room having a tea party.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, come and look at the food in your pink cup.<br />Tiffany: [Looking into the cup and playing along pretending to see food in the cup.] Yum, they look delicious.<br />Kenzie: There's nothing there. The pink pony ate all your food. Then she ate all of my food, too.		</p>

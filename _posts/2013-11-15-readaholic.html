<p>Kenzie has been a reader since the day she learned to read. She is a speed reader but still with high comprehension level. Earlier this year when they tested her reading, she was doing 222 wpm. And in her AR reading testing she has been getting 80-100 percent on all her tests. She is reading at 4-5 AR reading level. She is reading books like American Girl Dolls, Roald Dahl books, and she is reading Chronicles of Narnia (the series) with Nate before bedtime. </p>
<p>If she is missing in the house, you will find her tucked in her bed reading a book. She wants to read every second there is free time, like in the car. We are spending lots of money on books for her. But it's building up our library and hopefully the younger kids will enjoy them too. We had to buy another bookshelf just for all her books. </p>
<p>Her teacher from last year told her that when she reach 50 AR points, she could come read to her class as a mystery reader. She surpassed 50 AR points back at the beginning of October. The picture above was from Mrs. Wilson of Kenzie reading to her class. She had so much fun going to the first graders and reading to them. I had her bring leftover Halloween candy to the class as treats and she read an Amelia Bedelia book.  </p>
<p>Now in November she is at about 100 AR points. The first time the AR cart came around to give out prizes at the beginning of the year, she received 7 prizes. It's a little ridiculous. But I just let her do her thing. She needs 120 AR points in second grade to receive all her prizes with the last prize being breakfast with the principal. But this year, they have it where if complete AR prize list three times (360 points for her) then they get to go off campus with the principal for lunch. I'm not sure if she will do that or not. I am leaving it up to her. 		</p>

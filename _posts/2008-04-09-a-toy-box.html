				Our house has been in need of a toy box for a while now. I was tired of seeing Kenzie's toys scattered in every room of the house. So I finally commissioned my grandma to make Kenzie a toy box. I have always wanted some furniture made by Grandpa, and now I finally have a toy box! It came unpainted so I can use the leftover black paint from the entertainment center project a month ago. I was eager to get the toy box finished and working in our house. So I painted three coats in two days, starting on Monday when my mom dropped off the toy box at our house. I let it baked outside in sunny 74 degree temperature. And had it polished off and in use by tonight. Here is the finished product in the toy room. Thanks, Grandpa!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R_1qJ1kYIuI/AAAAAAAAB0Q/MS57mmn_Yu8/s1600-h/IMG_7948.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7948.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5187419063031702242" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R_1qKVkYIvI/AAAAAAAAB0Y/IgvuQhRG2II/s1600-h/IMG_7949.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7949.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5187419071621636850" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R_1qKVkYIwI/AAAAAAAAB0g/E6ODGUlc-Fw/s1600-h/IMG_7951.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7951.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5187419071621636866" /></a>		</p>

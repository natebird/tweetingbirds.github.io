				In my last flashback, I mentioned I would dedicate a whole post to the apartment where Nate lived when I met him - The Hole. The reason a whole post should be dedicated to this place is because of all of its unique personalities. Jeff, Braden, and Grant found the place over the 2003 summer. It was cheap and close to campus. Dirt cheap, unfortunately, they got what they paid for. To make the three bedroom basement apartment even cheaper, the guys looked for two more roommates (Nate and Taylor) to split the rent. Being in Washington at the time and enticed by the cheap rent, Nate agreed to live there and convinced Taylor to move in also.</p>
<p>The first week of school, none of the tenants could move in because of some problems the landlord had to take care of to make the place livable. Therefore, all the guys were nomads for a while living out of their vehicles, sleeping at friends' houses, and Nate, who had a gym membership at the time, took showers at the gym. Finally, the guys went in and helped finish up whatever needed fixing so they could start living there.</p>
<p>But even then, the place had unique personalities with a "coffee table" made of mini refrigerators that Jeff got from his job on-campus. They had an ancient, heavy, and giant TV that Jeff found at a dump and brought back - it didn't work. There were also about three or four microwaves in the house, mostly used as decoration. The couches were filthy, even the guys thought so. They used brown bed sheets as couch covers so people would sit on it.  The kitchen was tiny, couldn't fit more than one person in there at once. I don't even think the oven worked.</p>
<p>The Hole had a swamp cooler system that didn't work most of the time. In the winter, it pretty much didn't have heat. One day, we all noticed that the entire driveway was iced over. We looked up and saw water spouting off the top of their roof from the swamp cooler. It created a nice little ice skating rink in their front yard.</p>
<p>The guys lived in the basement while the first floor of the ranch house was rented to a newly married couple. The husband was in school and worked. The wife, literally, sat at home, watched TV, and gained about 80 pounds in that one semester the guys lived there. Every time we saw her, she kept getting bigger. Unluckily for Jeff, who had his own room but had to sleep the top bunk because the bottom bunk was made into a storage/desk area, he slept under a vent where he could hear every detail of the newlywed activities going on upstairs. There were many times when Jeff would end up sleeping on the filthy couch because he couldn't sleep with all the ruckus going on upstairs.</p>
<p>Another great memory from The Hole was when the landlord called the guys one day and told them not to come home for a day while it was getting inspected by Provo housing services. When the guys did return home, they found all their stuff thrown into a corner with sheets covering it and all the mattresses leaned up against the wall to make it look like no one lived there. Needless to say, it was in several violations of housing codes and probably some health codes also.</p>
<p>The dating situation of all of us at the time: Nate and I just started dating. Grant had been dating Kelly from the summer. And Braden had just met Cheri. Jeff was dating a girl name Jamie. Great stories about Jamie. And Taylor and Julia were engaged to be married that December.</p>
<p>I found the following pictures we had of The Hole.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SNAX7k4NssI/AAAAAAAACio/biXv9xiPLYw/s1600-h/Bradon+picking+up+the+cookie%27s+from+our+hometeachers.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Bradon+picking+up+the+cookie%27s+from+our+hometeachers.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5246719878165803714" /></a>
<div style="text-align: center;">The home teachers dropped off cookies while no one was home. And Braden found the cookies in the outside grill several days later when the home teachers called and asked if they received the cookies. This was the entrance to The Hole.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Nate bought a glass chess set that he set up. Every day, someone would move a piece and another person would respond. Neither one of them knew who they were playing against. This went on for several days. Grant and Jeff are playing chess on the coffee table made from mini fridges. </div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Grant had a fun time one morning trying to make some toast. He was trying to open a jar of jelly. When he got the jar open, it slipped out of his hands and the jar went flying one way landing on his bowl of cereal and toast causing them to splatter everywhere. This was the result. Notice the refrigerator in the living room/dinning room area.</div>

<div style="text-align: center;">Taylor sitting on the disgusting couches with the brown bed sheet covering it. And that's Nate's old Dell laptop that eventually died on us a couple years ago. This was back in the days when Nate liked Dell computers. </div>

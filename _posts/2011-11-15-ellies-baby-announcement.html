				We had these done a long time ago and actually sent them off about a month ago. But I'm just now blogging about it. We didn't do baby announcements for the other two girls. I don't know why. But here's Lai Lai's cute ones. I took the pictures and on the other side it has her name and birth stats. We printed them with <a href="http://us.moo.com/" target="_blank">Moo.com</a>. I love Moo. They do great printing quality at a great price. I used them for my SMM blog business cards too.</p>
<p>Then I made special envelopes for the cards and calligraphied everyone's name and address on the front. Turned out pretty cute I think.</p>

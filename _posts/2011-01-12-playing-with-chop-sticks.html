				You see her making a mad dash into the kitchen. Pull out the utensil drawer and start grabbing for it. For some unknown reason, she loves to play with chopsticks. And she knew exactly where to get them from a very young age. It drives me nuts because I find chopsticks all over our house. And a fair warning: If you come over and we eat Chinese food with chopsticks, ask for them to be washed first. Who knows where it has been.</p>

				Laney's favorite phrase to say is "Um… No, thank you." That's her answer for just about anything- brush her teeth, eating dinner, picking up toys, bedtimes, etc. Nate decided to take advantage of this…</p>
<p>Nate: Laney, do you want to eat your food?</p>
<p>Laney: Um… No, thank you.</p>
<p>Nate: Laney, would you like a car when you get older?</p>
<p>Laney: Um… No, thank you.</p>
<p>Nate: Laney, do you want to date boys?</p>
<p>Laney: [without hesitation] Yes!</p>
<p>Nate: [stunned] What?! Laney, do you want to kiss boys?</p>
<p>Laney: [without hesitation] Yes!</p>
<p>Nate: That didn't go as planned.		</p>

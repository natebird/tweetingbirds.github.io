				Kenzie and her dance team did so well in their first competition. And the girls also had so much fun together. She was very cute about it. She said she was getting nervous and could feel butterflies in her stomach. But because she likes pancakes, she said she wanted to call it pancakes in her stomach rather than butterflies. She was very excited for competition. They did a great job and remembered their routine. This was a small competition, but a good practice for their next one in May that is a national one. There was only one other group competing in this one that was their age category. But the girls placed first. They were so excited about that.</p>
<p>This was also Nate's first dance competition experience with many more to come I'm sure. And Laney shares a birthday with her dance teacher, Ms. Neta. So for the last couple of years we had gotten Ms. Neta a cupcake and Laney would make her a card on their birthdays. This year Ms. Neta gave Laney a card, a lollypop and some clip on earrings that the older girls wore for competition. That girl was in heaven. She thought she was so fancy wearing her earrings.</p>

				Shortly after Nora was born, I booked a condo at Myrtle Beach. We hadn't been to the beach in a few years and the girls were begging to go to the beach this year. And it was hard adjusting to four kids so I knew booking a vacation would make me feel better. Something fun to look forward to. We left the last week of school. I took Kenzie out of school the last two days of school. We left Wednesday morning and drove to Myrtle Beach. Got there around dinner time. We had so much fun at the beach. The girls absolutely loved playing in the sand and in the water. They didn't want to go home. And they all slept great each night because they were so tired from playing in the ocean. In fact, Lai Lai fell asleep eating at dinner on our last night. </p>
<p>We were there Wednesday through Saturday. We had to leave on Saturday because Nate had a work trip to San Francisco where he left after church on Sunday. We probably could have spent more time there since all we did was play at the beach and didn't do anything else. It would have been nice to do more stuff there in the city or even enjoy the resort more. </p>
<p>The girls even made a friend with another girl name Sophia and her little sister. Sophia was 6 years old. The girls had fun playing with her. We liked this beach because it wasn't crowded and the water didn't get deep until really far out from shore. So the girls could play in the water without me worrying about them. And we had great sunny weather during the day and rain at night. And the place where we were there was a salt water inlet that went out into the ocean where the girls could play too. And there were turtles, fish, and ducks that the girls could feed. There was so much to do there to keep the girls entertained. And since we were in a condo, we made every meal and saved money that way. So we just had to pay for gas to get there, groceries, and $100/night for the two bedroom/two bath condo. I have a feeling we will be going back. Such a great place and perfect set up for our family. </p>

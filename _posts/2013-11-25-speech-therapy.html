<p>Laney and her speech teacher, Mrs. Markosi. She started the speech class year with two other boys. Now there's only one other boy in the class with her. I have seen an improvement with her speech already. We have been working on her N words and K words. She has a trouble with words that end with N (she says it with DT sound at the end) and words with K in the middle (she says it with a T pronunciation). And they work on having her slow down. Her biggest problem is she is trying to talk fast and then she slurs her words. She loves her speech class and teacher. </p>
<p>We practice things with her at home. And I also started her on memorizing some sight words to prepare for kindergarten next year. Then when we read books together at night, when we come to one of her sight words I let her read it so she can gain the satisfaction of reading on her own. She is doing pretty well and gained a love of reading. I am so proud of her.		</p>

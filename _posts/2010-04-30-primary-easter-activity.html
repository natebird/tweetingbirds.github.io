				They didn't have an egg hunt. Which was fine because our church is being remodeled. But the primary did put on a great little activity for the kids. Kenzie was put into a group by age. She was the only girl with about 7-8 boys. She did well. I'm so proud of how she has really come out of her shyness as she has gotten older. She used to be very timid and almost a push over. So it's good to see she is standing up for herself.</p>
<p>This was her favorite activity, making resurrection rolls. It's crescent rolls with a marshmallow dipped in butter and cinnamon/sugar. It's actually quite good. We did it again last week for FHE at home.</p>

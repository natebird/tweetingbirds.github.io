				Ever since Laney came around, I have been thrown for a loop as I attempted several times to figure out a schedule that worked for all four of us. It finally came down to a print of out thisâ€¦ </p>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/Sg22KNeE2PI/AAAAAAAAEhM/ZC2Qcr4zhKM/s1600-h/schedule.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 307px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/schedule.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5336121420034660594" /></a><br />First day went fine, I even got some exercise in the evening. Then the second day, I realized that I didn't pencil in cleaning up after Nate, or a shower, or running errands, or grocery shopping as we depleated our stock of food in the freezer, refrigerator, and pantry. Somehow we have been living on no bread, no eggs, no freezer foods, no tortillas, no honey, and coming to the end of our milk today. It's been like this for at least a week. </p>
<p>It's not that we're on a new diet or I'm trying to starve my family. It's just I haven't had the time to go grocery shopping. And I'm still turned off by the idea of grocery shopping with a baby in the car seat and a toddler sitting in the cart building towers to knock down with my carefully selected items. The few attempts I have made shopping with both kids weren't traumatizing, but it's all the preparation and hauling of things and kids that I don't enjoy. </p>
<p>On the third day, I realized when I didn't leave room for story times, or play dates, or helping people (i.e. my brother apply for college) on the schedule above. </p>
<p>And yes, I am that much of an orderly freak that I have to print out a schedule and try to figure things out with different color pens, pencil, and paper. I am seriously borderline OCD. Which bring up my next point. I know people say when you're a busy mom, you have to learn to let some things go, i.e. cleaning the house. I can't do that because I can't live in a dirty, messy house. I literally lose sleep over it. I can't only do an OK job on my calling because I am the type of person who goes above and beyond the necessary. I can't ditch my kids in front of the TV so I can do my projects, not that I haven't tried that before. </p>
<p>So I just try to get in as much sleep as I can at night. Take a deep breath, then start anew the next day.		</p>

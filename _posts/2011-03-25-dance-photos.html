				Kenzie had dance school had photo week where they took professional photos in their recital costumes. We won't get the photos until May. But here is a preview with my camera phone. They will be dancing a tap number to "I'm Walking On Sunshine."</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3134" title="IMG_1016 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1016.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3135" title="IMG_1026 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1026.jpg" alt="" width="411" height="550" /></p>
<p>And where she used to have cute curls in her hair it's no longer in existence. Sad. Her hair is a lot like mine but Nate's hair color. Neither girl has my dark black color hair.</p>

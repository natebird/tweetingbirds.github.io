				Our birthday celebration continued with a midweek visit from Nate's family. We were thrilled to have Nate's grandma, Robert and Laurie (uncle and aunt) stay with us for a couple days. We have been trying to get Grandma out here for a while, she's from Idaho. And I had met Robert and Laurie briefly once before a few years ago. They are from Arizona. </p>
<p>We had so much fun visiting with them. They were so accommodating and understanding of our situation with two kids, having to do naps and nursing. Kenzie loved playing with Laurie and Grandma. They were so good to play dress up and shoveling with her. We also visited a nearby national park and a mall. Robert intrigued Nate with his business venture. Then we ate Chinese food at my parents' house. </p>
<p>We hope they all come back to visit again soon. We loved having them visit.</p>

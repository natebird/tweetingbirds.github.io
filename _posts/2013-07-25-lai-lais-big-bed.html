				Last weekend we made the transition of moving Lai Lai into her big girl bed. She had been wanting to get out of her crib for a while now. We pulled out the bed that was once used by Kenzie and went to the mattress store to get a third twin size mattress for the bed. We also sold the futon that was also in her room on Craig's List that same day to make room for the bed. She was so excited about her bed. Her sisters were excited for her. The first night she fell off about four times. Then she hasn't fallen off since then. And she has been pretty good with staying on her bed when it is nap time or bed time. That doesn't mean she takes a nap every time. But she does well at bed time. She loves telling people about her big girl bed. I also found a comforter set on super sale at Kohls for her bed. I'm not sure how we will decorate her room but it'll do for now. I'm hoping we will just move and I can worry about decorating the new house. I'm not looking forward to the next partâ€¦ potty training. I'll wait a few months before I start that. </p>

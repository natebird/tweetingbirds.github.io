<p>
				On our way to Red Robins for our birthday meal. </p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, where are we going?<br />Tiffany: A restaurant.<br />Kenzie: Why are we going to a restaurant?<br />Tiffany: To eat.<br />Kenzie: What are we eating?<br />Tiffany: Food.<br />Kenzie: Mom, what are you doing?<br />Tiffany: Sitting in a car.<br />Kenzie: Why are you sitting?<br />Tiffany: To go somewhere.<br />Kenzie: Where are we going?</p>
<p>After about 20 minutes straight of questioning from Kenzie while riding in the car, we were all getting restless. And ignoring her didn't work.</p>
<p>Tiffany: [annoyed] Kenzie, you are talking a lot.<br />Kenzie: I like to talk.<br />Tiffany: I think you're just making stuff up to say.<br />Kenzie: I know I am.		</p>

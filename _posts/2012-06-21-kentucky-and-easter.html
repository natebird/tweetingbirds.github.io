				Kenzie had spring break the week prior to Easter. And Nate originally had Good Friday off so we planned in advance to head on up to Kentucky to visit our friends Taylor and Julia. Taylor and Nate were best of buds in college. Since we all live in the southern region of the U.S., we try to see each other once a year.</p>
<p>They have three girls really close in age to our three girls. So there were 8 girls and 2 guys under the same roof. They used to live in Lexington and we had been there several times to visit them. Now they live in Louisville since Taylor got a new job. This was our first time seeing their new house. It was gorgeous.</p>
<p>Well, the day before we were leaving Nate received a work email saying they don't really have Good Friday off unless they had prior arrangements. So Nate got it off anyway. We took off Thursday night and spent Friday to Sunday there. Our girls had so much fun playing with their girls. We always have such a great time up there.</p>
<p>We also got there in time to celebrate Julia's birthday. Taylor made her an amazing cheesecake all from scratch. And we did a bunch of Easter stuff with the girlies since it was Easter weekend. We even did an egg hunt in the house. The adults had a great time hiding them and the girls had fun finding them.</p>
<p>We got back to Georgia in time to go to the egg hunt and Easter gathering at my grandparents' house. Double whammy.</p>

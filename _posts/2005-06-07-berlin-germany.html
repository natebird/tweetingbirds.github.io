				<a href="assets/IMG_3337.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3337.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />Parts of the Berlin Wall that is still standing. This is the third generation of the wall, meaning they made advances to it so it is impossible to get to the other side. You can see the pipe on the top of the wall. It is so those trying to climb over to the other side would slip off because they can't grab on to anything.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3339.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3339.jpg" /></a><br />Where the Berlin Wall used to exist, there is now a line throughout Berlin. Here I am standing on both sides of Berlin, east and west.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3318.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3318.jpg" /></a><br />The hotel we stayed at. It was on the corner of Uhlandstrafze and Pariser Strafze. It was a nice hotel where we all got our own rooms.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3424.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3424.jpg" /></a><br />The dome on top of the Reichstag.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3429.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3429.jpg" /></a><br />A smart car.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3427.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3427.jpg" /></a><br />The Brandenberg Gate. It was built in 1789. In 1806 Napoleon occupied the city of Berlin and wanted to take something home for souvenir. So he took that horse statue on the top of the gate. In 1814 the statue was returned to Berlin.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3419.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3419.jpg" /></a><br />This is the dome on top of the Reichstag, one of their government buildings like the parliament. The dome is opened to the public. You can see people walking to the top of the dome. The walkways swirl to the top and back down without running into each other. Since it is all glass, you can see all of Berlin from the top. It is a beautiful view.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3380.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3380.jpg" /></a><br />The Berlin Cathedral and Castle Bridge. The cathedral was erected in 1905 by J.C. Raschdorff.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3460.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3460.jpg" /></a><br />Watching the opera.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3452.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3452.jpg" /></a><br />Everyone in the group outside of Staatsoper Unter den Linden, the theater where we watched an opera by Gioachino Rossini. The opera was called, "L'Italiana in Algeri." It was in Italian with German subtitles. So we had a hard time understanding what was going on.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3443.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3443.jpg" /></a><br />The garden at the Jewish Museum of Daniel Libeskind.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3518.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3518.jpg" /></a><br />A group of us who adventured out looking for castles. This is the first one we ran into.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3485.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3485.jpg" /></a><br />A Berlin bear. It symbolizes welcoming of visitors to Berlin. They have bears in random places throughout the city.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3494.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3494.jpg" /></a><br />Eating falafals. It was very yummy.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3504.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3504.jpg" /></a><br />This is us getting lost in Potsdamm looking for castles, which turned out to be palaces. Here we are asking this nice German man for directions. However, he didn't know English. But he did tell us to go back to the train station where we came from and take the bus. Or at least I think that was what he was saying.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3552.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3552.jpg" /></a><br />One of the palaces we visited in Potsdamm just outside of Berlin. It was very hot that day (around 95 degrees) and we walked everywhere looking for these palaces.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3480.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3480.jpg" /></a><br />This is the Kaiser Wilhelm Memorial Church that was bombed in WWII. It is located at the Kurfurstendamm (Kudamm for short). The church was built in 1891-95.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3478.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3478.jpg" /></a><br />This is the Federal Press Conference. The conference was in German, so we didn't understand the topics discussed that day. Spokespersons from different ministries (departments) and the secretary of state (seated in the middle) are invited to have a press conference with the press a few times a week. They talk about topics discussed in "parliament" that day.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3475.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3475.jpg" /></a><br />This is at the Federal Press Conference. Adrianna and I are pretending to be asking questions.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3612.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3612.jpg" /></a><br />A memorial at the Sachsenhausen Concentration Camp. It was a labor camp for men. This memorial is located at the gas chamber part of the camp.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3625.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3625.jpg" /></a><br />The guys in our group at our farewell dinner.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3620.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3620.jpg" /></a><br />Other people in our group eating dinner. The guy on the right is our group leader, William. He is a native German that took us around to various places.</p>
<p><a href="assets/IMG_3622.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3622.jpg" /></a><br />Some of the journalists in my group. We are all from different parts of the United States.		</p>

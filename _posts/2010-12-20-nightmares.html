				Kenzie in the morningâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, I had a second bad dream last night.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Really? What were you dreaming about?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Well, the first bad dream was I was working on a silly computer.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Why was that a bad dream?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I don't like to use a computer. Maybe when I get older you can make me a computer. Or give me one. And I can use one.</p>
<p>Tiffany: What was your second bad dream?</p>
<p>Kenzie: There were silly hats and they had faces on them.		</p>

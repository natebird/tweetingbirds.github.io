				Alright, after a long and dreadful wait, I finally got my haircut. From all the comments on my <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/04/help-me-choose-a-new-hair-do/">last post</a> on helping me choose a hairstyle, I decided on #6 because I can do different things with it. I was supposed to get just a cut on Friday, April 11. I promptly showed up at my appointment having Nate get off work early to let me use the car (we have just one car) and watch Kenzie.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the salon, there were no customers, just a few stylists hanging around. I checked in at the reception desk and the lady said she was going back to get "someone," who I assumed would be my stylist Kaitlyn. It turned out to be a manager who explained to me their computer somehow booked two people for the same time with the same stylist, so they weren't able to get me in that day. She said they have been trying to call me, but the receptionist who took my appointment wrote down the wrong phone number. I was frustrated because Nate had gotten off work early, and I have been waiting for a long time to get my hair cut, and it's not easy working out the single car and babysitting arrangements.</p>
<p>To make up for their mistake, they gave me a complimentary cut, style, and color certificate for the next time I come. And they tried to reschedule my appointment. However, the next available appointment wasn't until June. I wanted to get my hair done before my Utah trip next Monday. So, they put me first on their waiting list.</p>
<p>First, they gave me a call the next day, Saturday, saying they have an appointment that just cancelled and was wondering if I wanted it but had to be there in the next 15 minutes. Since I didn't get the message until an hour later, I missed that one. Then, they called me on Monday saying they had an opening for a cut on Wednesday. With the complimentary cut and color they had given me, I told them I will be doing cut and color at my appointment, which didn't fit the time slot for the opening on Wednesday. Finally, they called back saying they have an opening Tuesday for cut and color.</p>
<p>I went in Tuesday hoping to get my hair done and they were able to make the appointment! My stylist was Kaitlyn who is an apprentice, but very good. She was suggested to me by my neighbor who also goes to her. I showed her the picture of the style I want and let her to her thing. She did great on my color. I wanted just subtle highlights.</p>
<p>The cut turned out to be different than the picture I had shown her, more of a Victoria "Posh" Beckham hairstyle. The back is layered a bit higher than I had wanted, but it gives me volume.  Now I just need the big bug eye sunglasses, the perfect skinny-after-two-kids bod, and the five inch heels to finish my Posh look.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SAYdhOk61BI/AAAAAAAAB18/SzZJ4llkov8/s1600-h/IMG_7961.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7961.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189868077276910610" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SAYdiek61CI/AAAAAAAAB2E/SAQ9c13oUUU/s1600-h/IMG_7964.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7964.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189868098751747106" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SAYdiuk61DI/AAAAAAAAB2M/eGVn09ysRw4/s1600-h/IMG_7975.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7975.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189868103046714418" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SAYdiuk61EI/AAAAAAAAB2U/xjH_rqN4gck/s1600-h/IMG_7986.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7986.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5189868103046714434" /></a>		</p>

				Nate and I took our first trip together without the kids since we had kids. We went on this trip because we had a voucher for AirTran left over from a previous trip. We had one night to choose where to go with that voucher. We ended up picking Tampa because it was far enough where it wasn't cheaper to drive and close enough where we could pay for both our tickets with the voucher. And neither one of us had been there before. We also counted this as our 9th anniversary trip. We were gone Thursday to Sunday. My parents kept the kids and they had a great time there. </p>
<p>Nate and I had such a fun time just sightseeing and eating out whenever we want. No schedule. We walked around the mall, drove along the coast, went to the beach, tried out a bunch of local restaurants, ate lots of seafood, walked around a flea market, and went to a photography museum. We loved Tampa. Such a fun place. Would love to go back with the kids one day. They would have liked the beaches. </p>

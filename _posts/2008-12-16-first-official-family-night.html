				Nate finished up with finals last Thursday! Yay! Finals week was rough on all of us. But it is so nice to have him around more for the next few weeks. I am still adjusting to him being home more. Kenzie and I are loving every bit of Nate time. Taking advantage of Nate being around more, I made an official family night last Saturday.</p>
<p>Side note: A while ago, Nate and I made it a date night to cut up our Halloween pumpkin (<a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/10/our-pumpkin/">remember</a>, we taped stuff on the pumpkin rather than carved it) to make pumpkin seeds and pumpkin puree to use in recipes. We ended up with over 16 cups of pumpkin puree. I decided to try pumpkin puree in any way I can sneak it into our food. I put it in Kenzie's mac and cheese one day and she loved it.</p>
<p>So, family night began with me making homemade chicken tenders that was stuffed full of nutrients. With the help of Jessica Seinfeld and her new recipe book, I took her idea and made some adjustments. I used pumpkin puree (which actually made the chicken tenders smell even better), Total bran cereal, and flaxseed. I didn't think Kenzie would even try it since it's meat and she doesn't usually eat meat, her choice. But that night, she ate two whole pieces of chicken tenders!</p>
<p>Next, we made rainbow cake together as a family. Keeping with my pumpkin puree kick, I made the yellow cake with some pumpkin puree in it. It actually made the cake really moist! I also recruited the help of Jessica Seinfeld again, then added to her recipe to make it a rainbow cake. The cake turned out to be a huge hit with all of us.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUczY5ALOPI/AAAAAAAAD1I/CepDj7uTlHM/s1600-h/IMG_9453.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9453.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280245590826629362" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUczY0rn43I/AAAAAAAAD1Q/ulbaHcEXqlA/s1600-h/IMG_9455.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9455.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280245589666685810" /></a><br />Finally, we made homemade dough ornaments for our tree. Nate and I have this tradition of adding an ornament to our tree each year that represents something from that particular year. This year, I decided we would make the ornament rather than purchasing one. I found a pretty good recipe for dough ornaments that was super fast and easy to make (no baking for 1-2 hours and let sit for several days before painting). Since we didn't get to the ornament making until pretty late in the evening, we saved the painting part for FHE Monday night. Kenzie had a great time spending time with both mommy and daddy.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUczYxc4cwI/AAAAAAAAD1Y/0F-v3wysYCs/s1600-h/IMG_9461.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9461.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280245588799550210" /></a>		</p>

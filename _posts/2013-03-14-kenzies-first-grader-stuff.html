<p>Kenzie loves first grade, her classmates, and her teacher. She has an awesome teacher this year. Mrs. Wilson has done amazing things with Kenzie. She is having a good year.</p>

<p>They had a fundraiser earlier this year doing a fun run where they asked for donations for each lap they ran. I wasn't a fan of this fun run. I am not a fan of fundraisers, period. Anyway, I came to the school to cheer her on as she ran laps around the school field.</p>

<p>Also this year she is doing amazing word for spelling tests where she learns more complicated words. Some of her words even surprised me because they were words that many adults get wrong. Boisterous?! She has been doing great with them though. And she's reading books like crazy. I have to slow her down by withholding books from her. So she just reads the old ones again. And I'm talking about chapter books here.</p>

<p>All dressed up for 50's day at school for the 50th day of school. I made the skirt last minute.</p>

<p>And at the beginning of the school year they had a school festival. Kenzie's teacher was in the dunk tank and she got to dunk her. That was a highlight of her year. She kept talking about it for days, "I got to dunk my teacher!!"</p>

<p>Call me crazy. Many of you all ready do. I started YET another blog. You have no idea how many blog domain names I actually own. Many of them with nothing on it.</p>
<p>Anyway, this blog is simple. Our lives through Polaroids. I found an awesome site with a application that turns digital photos to Polaroids. I take a photo a day and turn it into Polaroids. It's crazy the difference in the photo when turned into Polaroids. I love it.</p>
<p>I made a goal in 2010 to practice photography more and this is one of the way I am doing it. Plus, I plan on taking a photography class sometime this year. Any suggestions of a pro photographer?</p>

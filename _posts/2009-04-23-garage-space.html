<p>
				Yesterday my mom dropped off some furniture she bought at a yard sale that didn't fit in her car to be picked up later. </p>
<p>Today, noticing the furniture in the spot where Nate normally parks his car, or what Kenzie calls her car.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Hey, what's going on here?<br />Tiffany: Those are Puo Puo's furniture. <br />Kenzie: What are they doing in my garage?<br />Tiffany: Puo Puo is coming to get them later.<br />Kenzie: She needs to get them outta here.		</p>

				Every year we go to GG's house (my grandparents) for Easter. The teenagers and adults had a wonderful time hiding the eggs in the front yard and the little kids hunt for them. I had the girls wear their Easter dresses to GG's because we didn't make it to church that day. </p>
<p>Laney had a freak out Easter morning. She screamed for four hours straight and refused to eat for over eight hours. I even called the pediatrician's office. After a series of questions, the nurse determined she was fine other than the fact that she was crying profusely and wouldn't eat. The fact that she would eat concerned them enough where they wanted me to rush her to a pediatrician urgent care about 20 miles away. Motherly instinct told me she was fine, I just needed to get her to eat. Finally I pumped and she drank from a bottle then fell asleep. </p>
<p>Laney was fine the rest of the day. But since then, she would only nurse on one side at each feeding them. I'm having to adjust to that. She is getting enough to eat still by doing so. With all the craziness of Easter and Laney recuperating from her freak out that morning, I didn't get a picture of her in her matching Easter dress. I'm planning a redo this Sunday with their Easter outfits so I can get pictures. </p>
<p>Kenzie had a great time finding eggs with her cousins, less competition there. We also sang happy birthday to great grandpa. He calls Kenzie monkey. So for his birthday, she sang him a special birthday song, "Happy birthday to you. You live in a zoo. You look like a monkey, and smell like one too." He loved it.</p>

				We knew this was coming but weren't sure when exactly it would happen. We knew each day we would get closer to the day when we would need to fly out to Washington for Randy's funeral. Each time we talked to Cyndi she said Randy was inching closer to death but not quite there yet. It was hard for her to say when to come because she didn't want everyone showing up too soon and just hanging out, missing work and school.</p>
<p>Well, the phone call finally came Thursday evening, March 20th. I was actually in a stake meeting with Nora who was crying the whole time. Nate texted me to tell me that he had talked to his mom and she wants everyone in Washington as soon as they can get there. Randy was asking for his kids and mom to be there because he was going soon. When I got home from the meeting, we spent a couple hours looking for flights and talking to family correlating when everyone was going to be there.</p>
<p>After we purchased tickets, I went to sleep because I knew I needed some rest before the crazy days ahead. The next morning I got up at 5 a.m. and started packing. We told the girls that Friday morning when they woke up that we would be flying to Washington that day. It was totally last minute but luckily a week before we had the conversation with them about grandpa's situation and what may happen so they weren't completely surprised. I sent Kenzie to school for half day that Friday.</p>
<p>I had about six hours to pack all of us and prepare everything for our trip. We had planned on coming back in a week. All day Friday I had anxiety from the thought of flying all the way to Washington with four kids. I was mainly nervous about the youngest two. I had prepared some stuff before, purchased activities for the plane and bought a funeral dress for Nora. We had to purchase five plane tickets and had Nora as a lap child. She was four weeks old, not even old enough to have a birth certificate which they required at the airport.</p>
<p>Unfortunately there weren't any direct flights available since we purchased the night before. We had a short layover in Las Vegas. We barely had enough time to grab dinner for everyone and get on the next flight. It was a miracle but we all made it to Washington without much of a fuss. We landed at 8 p.m., which was 11 o'clock to us. Then there was the 3-hour drive to Nate's parents' house. We got there around midnight. We were extremely tired.</p>
<p>There were so many things that happened where you could see the hand of the Lord performing miracles for things to work out the way it did. One of them being getting all eight Bird children and Grandma Bird (Randy's mom) there by Saturday.</p>
<p>Randy didn't pass until the following Thursday. It took him longer than we had all expected for him to pass. Each day while we were there he would inch closer to death. But we had some amazing family moments and lots of spiritual moments. Those last moments with Randy was an intimate time for the family. And although it was a sad time, there were many wonderful things that happened tooâ€¦ Mike and Angel got engaged, John and Natalie found out they will be moving to Georgia for his 4-year residency at Emory, Randy got to see his two newest grandchildren (Nora and Asher), and we blessed the two new babies in their home.</p>
<p>Baby's first airplane ride at 4 weeks old. Luckily she slept most of the way there and back on the plane.</p>

<p>We surprised the girls Friday morning by telling them we were flying out that day. We bought the tickets after they had gone to bed the night before. Kenzie went to school half a day then we headed to the airport.</p>

<p>Since we left Atlanta in the early afternoon, by the time we made it to Washington the girls were super tired because it was about midnight our time. Lai Lai fell asleep like this as we were heading to baggage claim. We got to Nate's parents' house by midnight their time, or 3 a.m. our time.</p>

<p>The next morning we went to see Randy. He looked so frail. He got to meet Nora and he smiled. We had her snuggling up with him. It was so sweet.</p>

<p>The family hung around Randy often. He couldn't be left alone, and we just all wanted to be near him.</p>

<p>Laney had a great time holding the new babies, including her newest cousin, Asher.</p>

<p>It took a few days for the kids to adjust to the new time. So there were many mornings where the kids were awake at 5 a.m. And the dads had a little early morning daddy day care. It was so cute.</p>

<p>Another great thing from this trip was Grandma and Grandpa Roos and Grandma Bird were there for a while too. So they got to meet Nora and hold her often.</p>

				Nate and I are gaming people- board games, strategy games. We had game nights with friends all the time (life before kiddos). For Christmas the first year of our marriage I got Nate the game Acquire. It's one of our favorite games of all time. </p>
<p>We played often with our friends, Grant and Kelly. They were big into Acquire also. On their turns, Nate and Grant would take a long time figuring out strategies and try to count everyone's hotel cards. Kelly and I were just random players, no strategies involved. We stayed up long hours into the night having tournaments. We even kept a chart of our winnings. </p>

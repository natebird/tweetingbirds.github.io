				Last year, I was looking at the Black Friday sales in the ads and weren't very impressed with it. I thought I wasn't going to go. But then my friend Emily was looking for someone to go shopping with her, so I decided to go along for the fun. We ended up going to 7 different stores and spending 8 or 9 hours shopping. We got some great deals and fun stuff. Emily and I go shopping together every once in a while. Mostly for crafty things. It's nice to have a friend with similar interests and hobbies so we get together and do girly things while our husbands have fun with the kids. </p>

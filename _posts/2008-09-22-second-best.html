				I am frugal and always looking for the best deal. Rarely do I not purchase things on sale, discount, clearance, or with coupons. That's just me. But there are some things in life you must be willing to pay top dollar for, even for a thrifty person like me. I know some of you will probably disagree with me on some level with my list. And not to say I always pay full price on all the things on this list.
<ol>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Dental floss.</span> At first, I paid the $3.50/50 yard dental floss in the stores. And at first, I thought that was a bit steep for pieces of string I'm using to get plaque and food from between my teeth (hey, at least I floss!). So when I found dental floss at a discount store at $1/120 yards, I thought I was getting a steal! The difference: The cheap floss is held together by twisting rather than a minty wax. Meaning the string breaks easily and doesn't leave the minty after taste that I enjoy.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Baby diapers.</span> People always recommended the expensive brand name diapers to me and I used them. I tried Huggies and Pampers with Kenzie. Both brands costing about the same, and just switched to smaller amounts in a package/box and a higher price. But even then, Nate and I found Pampers worked better for us than Huggies. The difference: Pampers controlled and held blowouts (those with babies between 1-6 months know what I'm talking about) better than Huggies or other brands of diapers.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Cheese. </span>I love cheese - by itself or on/mixed with a lot of meals. And with the recent high prices of food, cheese has become almost a delicacy. Growing up, my mom sometimes bought the Kraft pre-sliced cheese (aka fake cheese). That didn't work well for me. The difference: The taste. I can totally tell.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Honey.</span> I grew up on local honey, and that's what I still get. Yes, I pay that extra dollar to help the local bees stay busy. The difference: It helps with allergies if you have any (fortunately we don't) and the taste.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Shoes.</span> I can't stand the thought of wearing someone else's shoes and all the germs that come with it. The difference: Germs, bacteria.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Most electronics.</span> This is mostly because I am married to someone who is deeply passionate about electronics and technology. Nate is the expert advice many of our associates consider when making an expensive electronic purchase. This can range from computers to cameras to cellphones and to gaming consoles.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Carpet cleaning.</span> Once again, this is Nate's thing. Because his father owes a carpet cleaning business and Nate has spent many years of his life cleaning carpets working for his father, Nate is our carpet expert. He knows how to treat all carpet and upholstery stains. We can't get our carpets cleaned by some company with the cheapest deal, it has to be Heaven's Best. He says it's not only because his dad owns a Heaven's Best, but because they do the best work and treatment for the carpet. Other companies, especially those that steam clean, doesn't clean the carpets as well. Plus, it takes longer for stream cleaning to dry. </li>

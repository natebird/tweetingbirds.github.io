<p>
				After walking away from her table in the playroom where Play Dough and accessories are scattered all over, I had this conversation with Kenzie.</p>
<p>M: Bubbles.<br />T: We can't play with bubbles because it's windy and cold outside.<br />M: Chalk.<br />T: Truck? [I had mistaken her chalk for truck.]<br />M: Vrooom!<br />T: Oh, you mean chalk. [It took me a minute for me to realize she meant chalk.]<br />M: Chalkâ€¦ OK! [Sounding like I was the one who suggested chalk and she's just agreeing that it's a good idea.]<br />T: We can't play with chalk because the sidewalks are wet.<br />M: Play Dough!<br />T: We are playing with Play Dough. It's on your table.<br />M: Oh, yeah. [Running to her table.] 		</p>

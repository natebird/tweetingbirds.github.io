				Kenzie is being tested at school for the gifted program. It's a month long process where they are taken out of class to take some scantron tests every few days. The first day of doing it, Kenzie told me thisâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: In the morning I have a new morning work now. I am working with a new person. She's an adult.</p>
<p>Tiffany: What's her name?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I don't know her name. But she makes sure we are smart and stuff.		</p>

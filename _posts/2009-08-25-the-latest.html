				I haven't done an update on the girlies in a while.</p>
<p>Kenzie:
<ul>
<li>After a year of loving Disney princesses, she is still in love with them. She passed through the Ariel and Aurora phase. Her newest love is Mulan. </li>
<li>Endless hours of princess playing. Endless requests of "Will you play princess with me?"</li>
<li>Quoting movies galore. She can quote any movie she has ever seen. </li>
<li>So good at making her little sister laugh. </li>
<li>Has a bossy side to her - part being the oldest, part advanced communication skills, part mom. </li>
<li>Learning to read her numbers. We are pretty much done with her alphabets (identifying capital and lower case, sounding out letters, identifying what letter any word begins with). </li>
<li>Has a talent for coloring and drawing faces. Pictures later.</li>
<li>Listens to primary songs every car trip which has helped her learn her primary songs - pretty much all the songs in the last half of the songbook. </li>
<li>The most obedient child I have ever met. I love it. </li>
</ul>
<p>Laney:
<ul>
<li>I love it when she claps. She does an elegant applause, not a clap. Held up high, one hand still, other hand does the up-down movement, and a huge grin on her face. </li>
<li>Fourth tooth came through a week and half ago. Top right. Toothless grin no more. she has rabbit teeth grin with two on top and two on bottom. </li>
<li>She's in the phase of devouring paper. Anything paper. It all goes in her mouth. Sometime it doesn't come out.</li>
<li>Drooling on everything and anything. Even has a drool rash under her chin to prove it.</li>
<li>Rolls around to get places. Desperately trying to crawl so she won't miss out on anything. Wants to be in the middle of everything.</li>
<li>Pulling self up on anything she can grip.</li>
<li>Still a thumb sucker. No matter how hard we try to make her quit. I still haven't given up. Never give upâ€¦ Never surrender.</li>
<li>Absolutely adores her big sister. Wants to play with Kenzie all the time.</li>
<li>Takes two 2-hour naps a day - I am grateful. Sleeps 11-12 hours through the night - I am blessed.</li>
<li>Does not like to swim in the pool. Now, baths are a different story.</li>
<li>Doesn't like her solid food cold. </li>
</ul>

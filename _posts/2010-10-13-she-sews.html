<p>Laney is interested in anything I do. If I am sewing, she wants to be right on my lap. If I am cooking, she wants me to hold her so she can see me stir. If I am cleaning, she'll grab a cloth and help me wipe. She is very involved. One of the great things about her personality. Laney is curious about everything. How it works and especially how it comes apart.</p>

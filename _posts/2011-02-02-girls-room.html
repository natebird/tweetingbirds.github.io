<p>We don't live in a big house and we are quickly running out of room. Although, I keep reminding myself that many people in the world lives with more people and less space in their home. I can make due with our home. First thing is get both girls in the same room. I have been wanting to redo Kenzie's room for a long time and now that we are going to put both girls in the same room, it's a great opportunity to just do it all at once.</p>
<p>We ordered a cute bunk bed from Target at a great price with free shipping. It's one that comes apart as two separate twin beds. It arrived at our house this Monday. And this past weekend, we started painting the girls' room. So I had this crazy idea on how I wanted to paint the girls' room and it's going to take a lot of work. We'll see how it turns out. Luckily we got most of the paints for free from Behr through Simply Modern Mom. So you'll see it on there once we are done.</p>
<p>Right now the girls are both bunking in Laney's room. The first night it took them an hour and half to fall asleep. The second night, not as bad. Probably only 20-30 minutes. But they were both up at 7 a.m. the next morning. Not cool. Nate and I will be super busy these next couple of weeks doing a whole lot of taping and painting and spray painting. Hopefully it will be super cool once it's done!</p>

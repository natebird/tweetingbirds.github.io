				Kenzie has a problem. She doesn't fit in any pants. This girl is too skinny. Her waist is the size of a 12-18 month old baby. Not too bad in the summer because I pull out old 18 month pants and have her wear them as shorts. But winter is tricky. She wears a 4T or 5T for length, but I can't keep any pants on her. She is always sagging. I thought I would be safe when I found these slim pants at Target. Nope. Still sagging. I would love to have this same problem. But nope. I have the opposite problem. I can't fit into my pants. Heh.</p>
<p>And the pants with the adjustable waist, they don't work either. I have to scrunch them so much that it makes her look like a balloon. So we just let her run around pulling her pants up every few seconds. I don't know what else to do other than to tailor each pair of her pants. Ha. That's OK.</p>

				Last weekend we drove to the Birmingham Temple with my parents to attend my cousin Lindsey's wedding. The sealing was Friday night at 6 p.m. central time. We left around 2:30 Friday afternoon and got home 1:30 Saturday morning. It was a wonderful and quick sealing to see Lindsey be married to Mo for time and eternity. Many of my family members were able to be there for the special occasion. We brought our kids along with us and Nate sat out in the waiting room with them while I was in the sealing.</p>
<p>Then on Saturday Lindsey had her reception at the church and we attended that too. I love occasions like this where you meet up with old friends you haven't seen in a long time. And our girls love to get together with their cousins who are their ages. And from the entire weekend, I didn't take any pictures. Oh well. I'll try to grab some photos from family.		</p>

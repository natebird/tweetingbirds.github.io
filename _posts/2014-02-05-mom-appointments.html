				I've been going with my mom to a few doctors appointments for her cancer to help her out. She wants to support and also she's not sure she fully understands what the doctors are telling her or what questions to ask. And a few times she is just too weak to go by herself. She started losing her hair at the beginning of January. Then we went with her to the hospital to pick up her wig. There Laney saw a long curly hair wig that she thought was awesome. She loves curly hair. She kept eyeing that wig. So before we left the hospital, I asked the hair stylist if Laney could try on the wig and she gladly let her put it on. She adjusted the wig to fit Laney's head then put it on. Laney was in heaven. She thought it was so cool. That face was priceless.</p>

<p>So the third baby is really expensive. First there's the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/07/swagger-wagon/" target="_blank">minivan</a> and then we find out that the Sienna and the Accord didn't fit in our garage together with the other stuff we had in there. The Accord and the Proteg√© fitted just fine together because they were both smaller cars. We had to figure something out. Of course this was happening the week before we left for Washington too. Everything happened that week! After doing research and figuring out what we needed and wanted to do in the garage to fit everything we need.</p>

<p>The biggest problems were the kids' bikes, strollers, lawn equipment, paint cans and other stuff like that. Nate decided to go with a tool shed that is similar to our neighbor's but a different size. And thanks to coupons, gift cards and money I had put away from Nate's birthday we were able to get the shed for a great price. We bought it the Friday before 4th of July. That Saturday, my dad came over to help Nate dig into the hill that's in our backyard. It was super hot and humid. They were both drenched in sweat before they even started digging. Then my dad came back on Monday on 4th of July to work on it some more. They spent 8 hours on Monday finishing up the digging, leveling and putting together the shed in the hot and drenching summer day.</p>

<p>They finished it just in time then Nate had a couple days to clear out our garage and move everything into the shed before we left for Washington so we can park both cars in the garage. Needless to say, we also had quite a bit of stuff to drop off at Goodwill. Now the garage is cleared and both cars are in. We're pretty excited about that.</p>

				Before Christmas I was able to go to the temple with my parents and Nate. It was a great day. The weather was dreary. And my mom just had a chemo treatment that made her really sick and weak. And the day before I felt pretty crummy with a cold. I tell you, Satan really works on you when you are trying to get to the temple. But it was a special day for us because I was sealed to my parents. It has been a long time coming and a lot of things had to be set in place for it to happen and it finally happened. And afterwards Nate and I went out on a date to Five Guys for lunch. My firs time there. It was pretty good. What a great day it was.</p>

<p>It was not fun being 9 months pregnant through the whole month of August. It was a hot hot month. I was pregnant in the summer with Kenzie, but only until August 9. I don't know why we did this again - having a baby in the summer. But wow wee. It is hot and humid outside. The only thing that kept me going was knowing that there are other parts of the U.S. that are suffering more than I. Say what you want about Georgia, but it's only like this for 2, 3 at the most, months of the year. The rest of the year it's nice. And the summer storms are pretty awesome here too.</p>
<p>And I was blessed in the sense that I didn't swell too bad this time around in the heat. I was still able to wear my wedding ring at 9 months pregnant. Yay!		</p>

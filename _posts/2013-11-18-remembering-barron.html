				November 8 was the anniversary of Barron's death. For the past 4-5 months Laney had been asking questions about Barron and talking about how much she miss him. We've been having good discussions with the older girls about life after death. It's good preparation for them for when Nate's dad passes. </p>
<p>Here are a few comments Laney had made about the situation.</p>
<p>Laney: Mom, I wish Barron could be alive because I miss him a lot.<br />
Kenzie: yeah. I miss him a lot too.<br />
Laney: Irene miss him a lot too. But that's ok. Jesus can heal him and he will be alive again. </p>
<p>We were talking about how the body will be resurrected with the spirit. </p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah, like when Jesus died and he was resurrected in three days.<br />
Laney: Mom, Barron died more than three days ago. How come he's not resurrected like Jesus?</p>
<p>On the anniversary of Barron's death we thought it would be a good idea to take the girls to Barron's grave.  We all wore our BarronStrong shirt that day. Kenzie remembers seeing his casket go into the ground but Laney wasn't there for that. So it was good for her to see what happens to body after death. The girls painted rocks for Barron that we left there. Then after going to see the gravesite, we spent the evening with Irene and Barron's parents at Grams and Pops' house. It was a nice visit. </p>
<p>We all miss Barron. But I am glad that the older girls still remember and talk about Barron. I hope they don't lose their memories of him. </p>

				(back in August) My little baby girl! I love her and love to squeeze her. She is adorable. And I love that her big sisters love her too. Another birthday that we just kept simple this year. It's hard having two birthdays so close together and close to school and other stuff starting. We went to Ray's Doughnuts and bought a dozen specialty doughnuts and had that as her cake. I didn't want to make another cake and have it linger around the house after Kenzie's birthday cake. Lai Lai loves doughnuts so she enjoyed it. Then we opened presents where her sisters also made her birthday cards and gifts. It was very cute.</p>
<p>Some things about this cute girlâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li>She loves Minnie Mouse, Clifford books, and anything orange. That's her favorite color.</li>
<li>She is a firecracker. Is great and cute most of the time but when she is not happy or doesn't get what she wants then she explodes into tantrums for a long time.</li>
<li>She is very smart and talks a lot. Having conversations with people.</li>
<li>She absolutely adores her older sisters, especially Laney since they spend the most time together. She loves it when they play with her.</li>
<li>She is still mommy's girl. She loves to hang out with me.</li>
</ul>

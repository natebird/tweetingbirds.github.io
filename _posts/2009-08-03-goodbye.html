<p>
<div>Our dear friends, Richard and Tannen, moved yesterday. Sad day. We had so much in common. We are pretty much living their life, just a year behind. </div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Richard and Tannen met at BYU. Nate and I met at BYU. That's pretty common. Millions of couples met at BYU. </li>
<li>Tannen comes from a large family of nine kids. Nate comes from a large family of 8 kids. </li>
<li>Tannen is from Oregon. Nate is from Washington. Both from the west coast.</li>
<li>Richard and I both grew up and have family in Georgia.</li>
<li>Richard and Nate both majored in economics at BYU.</li>
<li>Richard and Tannen have a daughter, Hailey, who has the same birthday as Kenzie - just a year older. </li>
<li>Richard and Nate both attended the same college for their MBAs - Nate is finishing a year after. </li>
<li>Richard and Tannen have a second daughter, Julia, who doesn't have the exact birthday as Laney, but she is a year older.</li>
</ul>
<div>Tannen and I are similar in so many ways it's actually funny, at least to our husbands who laugh at us. So many wonderful memories with them over the past three years.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We're going to miss them. Kenzie has been saying, "Hailey moved far, far away. But maybe she can come back and we can play again." </div>

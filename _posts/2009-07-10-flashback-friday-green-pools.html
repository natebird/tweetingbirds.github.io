The picture above was our pool at Union Square Apartments in Provo, Utah. Nate and I lived there for a year while we both finished our senior year at BYU. The summer of 2005, that pool was green more than it was clear. I think they were having problems with the filter or something.

<div>The second green pool experience was a bit more personal. My freshmen year of high school, we lived at my grandparents' house while they served a LDS mission. They had a pool in their backyard and in the winter, the pool was covered. However, after a harsh storm, hail punctured holes, some as large as a baseball, into the pool cover. That caused the grimy water on top of the pool cover to seep through into the pool. When we took the cover off the next spring, the pool was green as jello and full of algae, frogs, tadpoles, leaves, and so forth. It took a hard working filter, lots of chemicals, and vacuuming of the pool to finally get the water clear again. </div>

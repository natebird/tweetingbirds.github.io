<p>
				Sometime Kenzie's excessive humming can be annoying and Nate was trying to find someone to blame for it.</p>
<p>Kenzie: [humming to her own made up tune] Hum… Hum… Hum…<br />Nate: Kenzie, where did you learn how to hum?<br />Kenzie: In my bed.<br />Nate: Who taught you how to hum? [attempting to get Kenzie to say Tiffany so he can blame her]<br />Kenzie: You did, Dad.<br />Nate in thought: Dang.</p>
<p>A moment later.</p>
<p>Kenzie: What are you singing, Dad?<br />Nate: Some song I heard on the radio. I don't even know the words. </p>
<p>It's a musical morning at our house today.		</p>

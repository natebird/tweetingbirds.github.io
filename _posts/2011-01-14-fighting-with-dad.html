				This is why I would like to throw Nate's iPad in our neighborhood lake. He's addicted to it. Our kids are addicted to it. Anytime the iPad is around, there is someone on it. The kids use it to "read" Disney princess books and watch movies. I think they all ready get enough TV time as it is. They don't need to watch more stuff on the iPad too. And Nate uses it to "read" bedtime stories to Kenzie sometimes. I think it's a horrible way to read to your children. Can you tell? I'm not a big fan of the iPad. Why did Nate had to get it for free?</p>

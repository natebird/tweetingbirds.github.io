<p>
				I am at a point in my life where I am more realistic about New Year resolutions, I guess that's a way you can put it. Or perhaps you may think it's pessimistic attitude toward it. Each year I make goals and then forget about them a couple months into the year. Has New Year resolutions worked for anyone where they actually kept up with it for an entire year? So here's my one resolution for the year. It's one that I think will make a profound impact on my life. Hopefully I can keep up with it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Live in the present.</strong></p>
<p>I want to cherish the moments I have and make the best use of my time. Change my priorities so I focus on what is important in my life. Be okay with letting go a few things that take up too much of my time.		</p>

<p>Since I have a limited time before baby #3 arrives. I am trying to do all these things before the baby comes. One being volunteering at Kenzie's school. I'm not sure what I will be able to do once the baby arrives, especially since I will be nursing. So I have been helping in Kenzie's classroom once a week. The first week of school I went twice because the teacher said she could use some extra help. It has been fun getting to know the teacher and some of Kenzie's classmates through volunteering. I enjoy that. I want to be involved in my children's education.</p>
<p>It has worked out that Nate has been working from home once a week. He works from home when I have my OB appointments so he can watch Laney while I am at the doctors and volunteer.</p>
<p>I have been very impressed with Kenzie's school. All the faculty and staff are extremely helpful and friendly. Always saying hello to me in the hallways and smiling. I have seen the principal out in the hallways talking to students and greeting people. It's a huge school with 1,400 students in K-5 grades. And I have been very impressed with how efficiently they run things at this school.</p>
<p>I also like Kenzie's teacher. She is really good with the kids. Going in to the classroom I have realized that I am glad I am not a kindergarten teacher. Wow. I can't handle 26 kids each day. I don't have the patience for that. I am glad that Kenzie is in this school. When we purchased the house we looked at the schools. We didn't actually thought we would be in this house for as long as we have. But having a house in good school district is helpful with the resale of the house. And now that we will be in this house for at least a few more years, we are glad we are in a good school district. Blessings!		</p>

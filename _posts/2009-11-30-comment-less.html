<p>
				I just found out today that my RSS feed reader stopped sending me updates on my friends blogs! I still got updated from the never ending lists of crafts, photography, and design blogs I follow. But for some reason, a bunch of my friends and family blogs, it stopped updating me around Nov. 15. So I am so behind on everyone's blogs. So if you are wondering why I haven't been commenting on your blogâ€¦ well, now you know. I have about 94 posts to catch up on right now.</p>
<p>And if your blog is private, well, I haven't even got there yet because it doesn't show up on my RSS reader at all. That's why I love all those who still ready my family blog since it has gone private. I know how hard it is to remember to come here when you don't get the nice little reminders in your RSS readers. Kudos to you!</p>
<p>And I just have to put a plug in for my Simply Modern Mom site. I'm doing my Winter Days Giveaway going on now until Dec. 25. I'm doing back to back giveaways. So come and keep coming back to win some stuff!</p>
<p>Lastly, you'll have to forgive me this week. I am in the process of getting my online shop open because I have committed to another site, Sew Mama Sew, for a giveaway from my shop. Can't give anything away from my shop if I don't have one. Huh. So I'm pressed on time here to put things together, design the site, make some products, take pictures of the products, write descriptions, find out prices for products and shipping costs, so on and so forth. I have to open the shop by Tuesday night because the giveaway is Wednesday morning. AAAAHHHH!!! I hope I can pull it off. Some of you were asking. So that's the latest on my shop.</p>
<p>I also have a couple other sites wanting me to do guest posts and tutorial posts on their sites. So I am trying to write that up while keeping up with my own SMM blog. It's nice to get my name out there though and bring publicity to SMM. This whole professional blogging thing is pretty much taken over my life.</p>
<p>This is also Nate's last week of school until winter break. So he's gone all day and night doing final projects, papers, and taking finals. His last day will be Wednesday. Then I have YW activities Thursday and Friday nights. Then on Saturday I have a THREE HOUR meeting at a stake center that is 1 1/2 hours away, ONE WAY! And I have meetings all day on Sunday too.</p>
<p>If I'm still alive next Monday, I'll try to catch this blog up with our Thanksgiving and Kenzie's funny conversations. All I have to say is thanks to all my friends and family for your support, even if it's just kind works and encouragements. It means so much to me. And it keeps me going. So THANK YOU!		</p>

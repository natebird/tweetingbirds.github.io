<p>Our friends Jeff and Nicole came to visit us before and after Christmas. The drove up before Christmas to visit for a couple days. Then we took them to the airport to spend Christmas with their families out West. We picked them up from the airport on New Year's Day. They stayed with us for another day before heading back home.</p>
<p>Jeff and I were college friends. He is one of the reasons why I met Nate. Then later, he was Nate's roommate in college. Jeff and Nicole have a son who is almost a year younger than Kenzie. They played well together. Jeff is in the Army, so they move around a lot. We had such a great time having them in our home. We hope to see them again soon.		</p>

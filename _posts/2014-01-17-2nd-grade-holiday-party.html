				Kenzie had her class holiday party on the Monday before Christmas break. I was able to go in to help set up and take pictures. She was starting to get a cold that day and wasn't feeling her usual upbeat self. But she still had a great time. They made ornaments, decorated cookies, made reindeer food, and ate waffles. Between the cookies and the waffles they had more than enough sugar to last them until Christmas. And it was first thing in the morning too! I had her pack the cupcake for home later. She didn't need that too. Laney was at school for speech for part of the time then I had her come to the class party with me. She just drew pictures during the party.</p>

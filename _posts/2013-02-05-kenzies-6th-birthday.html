				I can't believe my girl is 6! Well, she's almost 6 1/2 now that I am so late with this post. Oops. She is in the first grade and loving it. For her 6th birthday, I was planning on doing a party. Then she told me she wanted a camera for her birthday. Nate and I looked into the price of a camera for her and it was the same cost as throwing her a party. So we had her choose if she wanted a birthday party with friends or a camera. She chose a camera. I was kind of glad then I didn't have to put together party. Her birthday was during the week, so I took cupcakes to her class during lunch. My mom came along to surprise Kenzie. Then that evening we had cake and opened presents. Then on Friday we took her out to eat at IHOP. She loves that places because they serve pancakes, her favorite. My parents came along. They gave her a fish bowl with a couple fish in it. She was pretty excited about that. It was low key but she enjoyed it.</p>

<p>Ever since I became a citizen, I made an effort to vote every presidential elections. I am really hoping and praying that Mitt Romney wins this time around. It's going to be a close election I think for popular vote. But we'll have to see what the electoral college come out to be. I actually voted early to avoid the long lines and just to get it done. I went with all three girls after school one day. The whole process took about 15-20 minutes. It wasn't bad and the girls were well behaved. Let's pray for a miracle that Romney wins!</p>

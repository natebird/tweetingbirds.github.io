<p>So what did we do all week with no schedules or plans? Well, we mostly hung out at the beach. The guys went in together and rented a longboard (surfboard), a paddle board and a kayak. Most of the people body surfed or were on boogie boards.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3925" title="IMG_6467 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6467.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>I kept myself hydrated on shore trying to get a tan. And every once in a while I would get in the water to float. It felt good to float my 7-month pregnant belly. The water was the perfect temperature. And Nate, well, he played all day long and enjoyed every bit of it. It's nice that I have cousins his age and he also gets along great with all the guys in my family. They just had the best times being beach bums. One morning he even got up at 6 a.m. to head for the water.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3926" title="IMG_6470 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6470.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="351" /></p>
<p>We also visited the shops on the island. We did that on afternoons when it was too windy to play on the beach. There were a couple days where the winds were so strong that you couldn't get in or out of the water without being pushed several yards away. But that worked out great with our kids' nap schedules. Each day they were so tired from being at the beach and in the sun that they didn't have any trouble taking naps or going to bed at night.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3927" title="IMG_6500 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6500-1.jpg" alt="" width="425" height="550" /></p>
<p>In the evenings we played games, went crab hunting with flashlights, played at a park and went for walks on the beach or along the pier or boardwalk. We also collected seashells and stones. Or in Laney's case, she collected seaweed. A few evenings we got together, the entire family, for Family Home Evening and another night to celebrate birthdays (three people had birthdays while on vacation). And we also all went out to eat our last night on the island.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3928" title="IMG_6504 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6504.jpg" alt="" width="421" height="550" /></p>
<p>One night Kenzie got sick. Nate was sick two weeks prior to vacation with a nasty cold. Once he was done, he gave it to Laney and me the week before we left for vacation. Luckily we were on the tail end of it when we got to the beach. Kenzie was fine until Tuesday night. She got the virus from us and woke up in the middle of the night with croup (she gets this often when she catches a cold). Unfortunately we had left her inhaler at home. So we steamed up the shower and the guys gave her a blessing in the middle of the night. She was fine afterwards. The following day we kept her out of the water and had her rest. She was fine after that, just left with a cough.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3929" title="IMG_6516 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6516.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="383" /></p>
<p>Another day, Nate took Kenzie on her first daddy daughter date. They walked over to a bakery and both enjoyed a huge cupcake. Then Nate taught her how to play War with cards. Kenzie had been looking forward to her daddy daughter date ever since Nate told her about it. I love how our girls admire their father.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3930" title="IMG_6539 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6539.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="389" /></p>
<p>On the way to the beach, we took our time getting there. We left Friday after Nate got off work and drove half way. We spent the night at a Marriott hotel in downtown Columbia, S.C. Then left Saturday morning after breakfast to drive the rest of the way. It made the drive with the kids a little easier on the way there. And we were able to get to the beach house early enough to take a dip in the ocean on Saturday.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3931" title="IMG_6558 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6558.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>But on the way back, we left at 9 a.m. the following Saturday morning and drove the entire way home. It was supposed to be an 8 1/2 hour drive, with no stops. Not when you are driving with Nate though. We stopped one time on the way home at a gas station for gas and potty break then drove the rest of the way home. Yup. We made it home by 4:45 p.m. Good thing we ate breakfast before we left and I packed sandwiches for lunch, which we ate in the car. We had planned on stopping at a rest stop to have a picnic lunch but Laney fell asleep. So Nate took opportunity of that and kept driving. We passed most of my family who had left an hour before us. Crazy Nate.</p>

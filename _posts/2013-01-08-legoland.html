				As part of the girls' Christmas gift we took them to Legoland. We had been wanting to go all year. I found coupons for the place that was a pretty good deal and we went on a furlough day right before Christmas break. Went with some friends and had a great time. Wasn't too impressed with the place. For a place called Lego-<em>land</em>, it's pretty small. The girls still had a great time and didn't want to go home. There were Legos everywhere. They rode the two rides and watched a 4D movie. We spent about 3 hours there. I don't know if we will go back there again. I don't think it's worth the regular price of entrance fee. They did the Lego master workshop where they made a Christmas ornament. Had to pay $5 for it. They had fun with that.</p>

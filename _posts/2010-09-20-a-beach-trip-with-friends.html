<p>In between Nate's last week of classes and finals week, we took a short weekend break to Fort Rucker, Alabama, to stay with our friends Jeff and Nikki. They are college friends and some of our best friends in the world. Jeff is serving in the Army flying helicopters and they move around a lot like many other military families. This was our only chance to see them before they moved to New York and Jeff deploys for Afghanistan for a year.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1853" title="IMG_4048 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4048.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="411" /></p>
<p>We had so much fun with them. With Nate's work we left Friday afternoon and arrived in Alabama in the evening. The girls were excited to see their friend, Nick. He is a year younger than Kenzie. He's so cute and played so nicely with our girls. And we had a great time catching up with Jeff and Nikki. And they had Nikki's teenage nephew Austin staying with them too.Â Jeff and Nikki lived on post and it was my first time being on any military base. It's pretty nice there. I couldn't believe how big it was. It was like it's own city.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1841" title="IMG_3918 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3918.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>The next day we headed to Destin, Florida, to the beach. It was about a 2 hour drive and we all rode in their old Suburban. It was so much fun. We haven't been to the beach in a long time. And with Jeff's military benefits we were able to go to a beach in Destin only for military families. It was only $2 to park and it was pretty much a private beach. It worked out perfectly since we were there on a Saturday and there were a ton of people in Destin that day.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1842" title="IMG_3928 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3928.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="401" /></p>
<p>The beach was beautiful. And they had tons of nice amenities -- showers, bathrooms, pavilions and picnic tables. No oil balls from the BP oil spill. The sand was shimmery white. The water was warm and blue. Not a lot of waves and the water was full of seaweed, but that didn't bother me. I'm used to seaweed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1843" title="IMG_3931 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3931.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1844" title="IMG_3947 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3947.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Kenzie loved playing in the sand. She kept wiping her mouth with her sandy hands and then she would spit out the sand. She had spit and sand all over her face.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1845" title="IMG_3950 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3950.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="392" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1847" title="IMG_3972 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3972.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="400" /></p>
<p>Laney. She's our water girl. She would walk right into the ocean without a second thought. She sat and stood on the boogie board. She also enjoyed playing in the sand.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1846" title="IMG_3954 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3954.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1849" title="IMG_3995 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3995.jpg" alt="" width="402" height="550" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1850" title="IMG_4004 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4004.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Then that night we went out to eat at a local restaurant. A balloon guy came around and made Kenzie a pink dinosaur and Laney a brown monkey. Before we even left the restaurant, Laney bit her monkey and deflated its body. Only the tail and head left. That is so Laney. That's just her style. I love it.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1851" title="IMG_4031 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4031.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1852" title="IMG_4038 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4038.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>We partied hard and by Sunday the kids were pooped. Laney was pitching fits. Just in time for us to leave. We left on Sunday after lunch because Nate had to work Monday morning. It was sad to leave our friends. We didn't know when we were going to see them again because of their work. But it was good while it lasted.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1855" title="IMG_4069 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4069.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Aren't these kids cute together? We hope they end up being friends forever.</p>

<p>Kenzie's first kiss from a boy. How sweet. She even lifted her hair for him.</p>

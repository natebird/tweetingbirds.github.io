				So I'm already working on my list of 30 things to do before I turn 30. I only have 6 months to do everything! Last weekend we crossed #13 off my list, go to a sports game. BYU came to Georgia to play Georgia Tech. We couldn't let this opportunity pass without going to the game. Especially since Nate is an alum from both schools. We dropped the kids off at my parents' and dad watched them most of the day. Then they took the girls to their ward trunk or treat. I'm glad I am not nursing any more so I can leave Lai Lai.</p>
<p>Nate and I had such a fun time at the game with our friends from the ward. We also saw a bunch of other friends, missionaries and Nate even met up with an old mission companion who was at the game covering for the Daily Harold (newspaper in Utah). He's a sports reporter. BYU beat Ga Tech 41-17. Nate wore a BYU shirt and a Ga Tech jacket, cheering for both teams. I just had on my BYU gear since that's my alma mater. We had the Smiths and Sam and Mia on the way there and just the Smiths on the way back in our van. We parked at Nate's work since it was walking distance to the stadium and free parking.</p>
<p>After the game we all went out to a little Hispanic restaurant with all the friends and ate some yummy food. And one of our friends even picked up the tab for everyone! They were way too generous and wouldn't let anyone pay them back. We'll just have to do a secret Santa or something for them this year. Such great memories made!</p>

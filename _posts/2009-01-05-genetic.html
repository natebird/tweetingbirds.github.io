				Totally weird and totally random. I used to lay around like this in college because it was comfortable. I know, weird. I'm kind of embarrassed that Nate caught it on camera.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SV_X0CpnQZI/AAAAAAAAD88/4L15R3YGfNA/s1600-h/new1+040.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/new1+040.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287181776620831122" /></a></p>
<p>And now, I find my daughter doing the same thing. She has been doing this for a few days now and I finally was able to catch it on camera. She did this the other day and I pointed it out to Nate. He was questioning how something like that could be genetic since Kenzie hasn't seen me do it before.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SV_X0f8BiUI/AAAAAAAAD9E/lNirFCvCQQg/s1600-h/IMG_9643.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9643.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5287181784482679106" /></a>		</p>

				Kenzie at almost 20 months. This is not to brag, but a way for me to remember what she is like at this age.
<ul>
<li>She can say two word sentences.</li>
<li>She can turn on and off her toys that make noise. But because she knows how to turn off doesn't mean she does it. </li>
<li>She loves to cook, still. </li>
<li>She can read/identify the letters of the alphabet. She has a hard time with the less often used letters like X, V, and Q. She knows Z because it's in her name. </li>
<li>She sings songs, but not in words we know.</li>
<li>She can open caps, boxes, containers, just enough to get her into stuff.</li>
<li>She learned the motions to Itsy, Bitsy Spider during FHE last Monday. </li>
<li>She can identify most of her body parts in Mandarin - feet, hand, eyes, eye brows, nose, ears, hair, head, bottom, mouth, tummy. </li>
<li>She can name and identify most of her body parts in English - adding to the list above, chin, cheeks, knees, shoulders, toes, fingers, teeth, tongue, belly button. </li>
<li>She can identify and say the shapes heart, star, square, triangle, and circle.</li>
<li>She can count up to 2 by herself and 6 with help.</li>
<li>She is learning to clean up after herself. Yay, for me!</li>
<li>She takes one nap from 2 p.m. to about 4-5 p.m. And goes to bed between 8:30 or 9 p.m.</li>
<li>She puts herself to sleep, but needs to have her Night Night (blanket) and a stuffed animal go to sleep with her. Sometimes it's an object like her Elmo cards or bunny ears. We usually ask her which stuffed animal is tired and we put the animal to sleep with her. </li>
<li>She feeds herself with spoon or fork with minimal amount of mess.</li>
<li>She loves Elmo and Pooh right now even though we don't watch Winnie the Pooh or Sesame Street. </li>
<li>She loves to say prayers by repeating the last word of the sentence or nodding to what we say. She always make sure to bless mommy, daddy, grandma, grandpa, Dude (what she calls her Dudepa, my dad), and Puo Puo (what she calls my mom). We often bless the same meal several times as she folds her arms indicating it's time to pray. And she puts on her serious prayer face when saying a prayer. </li>
<li>She can say three Mandarin words: mei mao (eye brows), bi zi (nose), and Puo Puo (grandma).</li>
<li>Her vocabulary has expanded to over 100 words. I can't keep track of them anymore.</li>
<li>I have been teaching her to ask for help when she can't do something herself and it has been working as I hear her say, "Mommy, help."</li>
<li>She is very particular about things, a detailed oriented person (like her mom). Things go in certain places. </li>
<li>She has an amazing memory. Only have to show her something once and she'll remember. </li>
<li>She can tell the difference between a boy and a girl. And she has already told her dad she likes boys and wants to date them. Nate asked Kenzie if he needed to have a talk with her about dating boys and she shook her head. </li>
<li>Her favorite TV show is still Super Why (she calls it soopie). It has helped her learn her alphabets. </li>
<li> She can identify and say the colors blue, red, brown, green, yellow, pink, black, and purple. </li>
<li>She loves to each yogurt, applesauce, cookies, cheese, crackers, and strawberries. </li>
<li>Still loves to color with crayons and read books.</li>
</ul>

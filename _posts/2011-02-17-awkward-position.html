<p>Kenzie has been doing quiet time downstairs because Laney takes a nap in their room the same time. Well, a couple of times Kenzie fell asleep during quiet time. She doesn't nap much anymore. But since her and Laney have been bunking together in the same room, a few times they stay up talking and playing around. So it was wearing on Kenzie who fell asleep like this one time - between the LoveSac and the couch. Ouch.		</p>

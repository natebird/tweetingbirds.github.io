				I've made a few new friends lately. First is one of the moms in Kenzie's dance class, Vanessa. Her daughter was in Kenzie's dance class last year and I would talk to her a little here and there. She was also a blogger but I talked more to the other moms. Then this year we have really gotten to know each other better and we talk to each other all the time. We met up once at Trader Joes to go shopping. </p>
<p>Then I also have gotten to know Angela who is Kenzie's best friend's mom. They are really quality family. She is a few years older than I am so we are definitely from different generations. But we still have lots to talk about when the girls get together. </p>
<p>And finally, I have become better friends with Camille in our ward. I've known her for a while now but more recently we've been doing more things together and doing dinners. They are also top notch family and just amazing, quality people.  		</p>

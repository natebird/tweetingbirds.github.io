She is better at it during meal times since she is sitting in her highchair and can't get out. During family prayer in the evenings, she kneels down, folds her arms, and bows her head for prayer... for the first few seconds. Once she sees us with our eyes close and the prayer started, she gets up and does her own thing - read books, play with toys, walk around the house, and so on. I usually try to grab her before she gets too far and have her sit on my lap for the remainder of the prayer.		</p>

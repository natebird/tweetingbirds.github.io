<p style="text-align: left"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-6553" alt="Screen Shot 2013-01-04 at 2.43.19 PM" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Screen-Shot-2013-01-04-at-2.43.19-PM.png" width="396" height="241" /><br />
I made a list of memorable moments from the last 30 years of my life. It's interesting to see that majority of the moments are things with family and Nate. The image above is the last part of my list. I had a bit of a rough beginning in life but it's not what we have been through that makes us who we are. It's how we react and progress from the things that happened to us that makes us who we are. People can have rough times in their lives, in fact everyone will have trials, but we don't let it control us. We create the outcomes.</p>

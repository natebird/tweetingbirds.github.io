I somehow managed to get both kiddos asleep for naps today to make these delicious cream puffs. One was down by 2 p.m. and the other by 3 p.m. I needed to have the cream puffs done by 4:30 p.m., in time for our YW Girls Camp Fundraiser spaghetti dinner and dessert auction tonight. I slaved over double batch of the cream puff from 1:30 until 4:20, with 10 minutes to spare!</p>
<p>Results: 59 scrumptious cream puffs and a post on my blog about it. Hopefully they will sell high to help the YW raise camp money. Check back tomorrow to see what the puff sold for.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">I didn't end up putting the cream puffs for auction because we had a ton of dessert from the girls. I wanted to make sure all of their desserts got bids. I just brought the cream puffs to donate to a girl if she didn't bring a dessert. So I got to bring the cream puffs home and eat them myself! But the fundraiser went well. We raised enough money to pay for at least half of the camp money for each of the girls! Some raised almost all their camp money amount. </span>		</p>

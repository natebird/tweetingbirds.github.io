				Aaaahhhh… You know what? I'm falling behind. Yes, it's true as you have seen missing posts throughout the week the past few weeks. What can I say… it's a combination of the up keep of two blogs, up keep of two girls, chasing after Christmas gifts on sale, making Christmas cards, taking photos left and right, managing everything without the presence of a husband, combating illnesses, and who knows what else.</p>
<p>Forgoing Flashback Friday once again. Here's the 411.</p>
<ul>
<li>Just yesterday, Laney had regular poop again. Yes, it was about a month ago when I told you about her poop problem. It has taken a month for her stomach to be right again.</li>
<li>Kenzie is a teenager in a little body. Her popular phrases are… "I don't WANT to," or "Don't talk to me like that," or "Mom, come down here," or "I don't like it," or "I don't want to go to bed," or "No, it's not," or "I don't want quiet time," or "No I didn't," or "Come get Laney out of my playroom." But even though she says those things, she is still pretty obedient. We just have to work on respect and her attitude.</li>
<li>Nate got a contract job doing programing work. He has also a couple side jobs doing websites for a few people. Nice for him to be working for pay.</li>
<li>I am trying to open an online shop selling a few of my craft stuff. I'm not sure how it will be received, but it's still a work in progress. I'm hoping to open shop in November.&nbsp;</li>
<li><a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/">SMM</a> is going well. I have about a readership of 50-70 people a day. Two days ago, my numbers hit 2,000+ readers to my site in one month. It is numerous hours of work and more work. Thanks for the support and telling your friends and family about SMM.</li>
<li>Laney walks around the house pushing her walker toy or a chair in our dining room and kitchen. She will also walk if we hold her hands. She doesn't stop of anything. Not even walls. She'll just turn and keep going.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Laney also had her 6th tooth popped out a week ago. She's a chomper. She loves eating bread, bananas (not cut up), crackers, and pretty much anything she can grab with her little fingers.</li>
<li>I have always used my hair cutting skills on others, mainly Nate and Kenzie. But for the first time a week ago, I tried it on myself. I gave myself bangs. Pictures coming next week.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
<div>Happy Halloween!&nbsp;</div>

<p>Kenzie was having a hard time adjusting to all the changes happening to hear in August. And she usually take it out on having accidents. So we started a "No Accident Jar" where for each day she doesn't have an accident she puts a fuzzies in the jar. Then when she gets 30 fuzzes she gets a special treat. Her special treat was going to an frozen yogurt store where you put your own toppings. She loved it. It was some much needed mommy and daughter time. And we haven't had problems with her having accidents since.</p>
<p>Part of it was her learning the routines and rules at school. She had a couple of accidents while at school the first few weeks of school. The first time was at recess. And a second time during P.E. When I talked to Kenzie, she said she was holding up the bathroom sign (a signal so the teacher knows when they need to go to the bathroom) but the teachers didn't see her. After talking to her teacher, it turns out the bathroom sign was only for her class. The other teachers didn't know what that meant. So we talked to her about going up to the teacher and telling them so she doesn't have any more accidents.		</p>

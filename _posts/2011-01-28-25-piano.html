<p>We've had this piano for a while now but totally forgot to post about it. My mom found the piano at Habitat for Humanities. It had a "Sold" sign on it but the clerk told her that the person who bought it was supposed to pick it up days ago. They have a 24 hour pick up policy. It had been left there for days. They decided to resell it. My mom called me to see if I wanted a piano for $25. I asked Nate and he said, "Of course!"</p>
<p>Everything works, but it is out of tune. We haven't put forth the money to get it tuned yet because it's kind of expensive and none of us really play the piano. So we'll just wait on that. It didn't come with a piano bench so we had my grandpa make us one. It worked out perfect.</p>
<p>It's a Henry Miller upright piano. Nothing fancy. But it works great for us. I love hearing the kids bang around on it. I love the sound of piano in my home.</p>

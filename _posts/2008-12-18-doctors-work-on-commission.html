				To be more specific, do nurse practitioners work on commission? Once again, Kenzie is sick with what I think is bronchitis since she has the same symptoms as her bronchitis a month ago. It started out as a cold caught from nursery (both times), which caused wheezing, and turned into infection of the cold and, somehow, it all equaled bronchitis in my poor child. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Point #1: I'm seriously considering taking Kenz out of nursery for the winter. I am tired of her getting sick on Mondays or Tuesdays just for two hours of nursery on Sundays. Plus it is costing me a lot of money!</span></p>
<p>Anyway, I spent most of my day yesterday in a doctor's office or at a pharmacy. The day began with my OB checkup. Status update on that later in another post. After my appointment, I ran some errands when Nate called and said Kenzie had a fever of 102.</p>
<p>Back track a bit, the illness actually began last Monday with runny nose. Then wheezing and low fever of 99 on Tuesday. Wheezing and fever mostly gone by Wednesday thanks to her inhaler and Tylenol, but had coughing and runny nose. The coughing and runny nose lasted the rest of last week. I didn't put her in nursery last Sunday because I am NOT one of those moms who put their kids in nursery with runny nose or coughs. Instead, she was with us the last two hours of church.</p>
<p>So, yesterday, Nate said Kenzie had a fever of 102 with serious coughing and wheezing. I called the pediatrician who recommended her coming in to be seen- <span style="font-style:italic;">of course, that's $30 in co-pay right there</span>. I set up an appointment for early afternoon with the nurser practitioner (NP) since her regular doctor wasn't in that day. We go in, they check her oxygen level and it's at 95%, not bad. The NP came in and asked about Kenzie's symptoms. I told her she had all the same symptoms as her bronchitis a month ago. The NP spent no more than 2 minutes listening to Kenzie's chest, looked in one ear, and shined a light up her nose. She checked nothing else. And during our office visit, she walked in and out of the room about 4-5 times mid-sentence. It left me clueless as to what was going on and what she was talking about.</p>
<p>Somehow, Kenzie's wheezing was the NP's main and only concern. When I told her that we have to pin Kenzie down to give her the breathing treatment with the aerochamber and inhaler, she immediately suggested using a nebulizer machine instead. The nurse rushed to get the machine and wanted to bill our insurance for it immediately. They did one breathing treatment with the nebulizer in the office. It was my second worst experience as a mother holding Kenzie down while the nurse try to put to mask on her face. Kenzie didn't like the mask on her face, it was scary for her. And she didn't like the machine's noise (she still doesn't like machine noises like blender or vacuum). She cried, screamed, and struggled like we were breaking her apart limb by limb. I was about to break down and cry. It lasted a good 8 minutes or so. Poor girl! In the end, I think I probably inhaled more of the albuterol than she did.</p>
<p>After that torturing experience, for the both of us, Kenzie quickly fell asleep on my shoulder. The NP came in to actually have a conversation with me for the first time during our whole visit there. She said nothing about Kenzie's fever or bronchitis other than give her Motrin. I had to ask for some kind of antibiotics. All she wanted me to do was give her the breathing treatment at home 4 times a day for a month. I said the aerochamber would probably work better since it's only a few seconds of her crying rather than 8 minutes of crying and holding her down 4 times a day. <span style="font-style:italic;">But the NP really wanted me to take the nebulizer machine home (probably so they can charge my insurance for it).</span> They checked her oxygen level and it actually went down to 93% and she had shortness of breaths. On the car ride home, she started wheezing and coughing again. So the nebulizer machine, sitting on the passenger seat at the time, didn't even help. The NC said it takes several treatments for it to work well. Sureâ€¦<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUrSqSK0uRI/AAAAAAAAD2o/mTbspY4Qrsw/s1600-h/panda.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 129px; height: 150px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/panda.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5281265136918903058" /></a><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">The NP wrote three prescriptions that came out to be $130 for all of it at the pharmacy, yes, that was the price after insurance.</span> Plus, the prescriptions were all written for the wrong quantities, even I saw that (I can read Rx since I used to work as a pharmacy tech)! Needless to say, I didn't purchase them. I called the office back to have them change the antibiotics to something my insurance paid for. And yesterday, rather than making Kenzie do the nebulizer machine again, I went back to the inhaler and that worked out a lot better, less scarier. Plus, the inhaler stopped the wheezing and coughing <span style="font-weight:bold;">immediately</span>.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUrSqKVlSsI/AAAAAAAAD2g/It5mRy0dLiQ/s1600-h/inhaler.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 300px; height: 300px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/inhaler.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5281265134816545474" /></a><br />Not only did the NP had me take home the nebulizer machine and wrote expensive Rx in the wrong quantities, <span style="font-style:italic;">she also wanted me to set up an appointment for her to check up on Kenzie's wheezing this Friday and in two weeks, which means $30 each visit</span>. Yeah, I didn't go for that. <span style="font-weight:bold;">Point #2: We're never going to see that NP again! I'll stick to our regular pediatrician. </span>		</p>

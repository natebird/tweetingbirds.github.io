As always, we went over to Scott and Stacey's house to watch it. We were missing half of our usual crowd this year. The Bishop and his family were there, but we were missing Barron and Irene who were in D.C. visiting family. Kenzie had a fun time playing with Mia and Madison.</p>
<p>I love being able to take off the weekend to get spiritually uplifted. It never cease to amazes me how our prophet and general leaders know exactly what I needed to hear. There were so many <span><a href="http://lds.org/conference/sessions/display/0,5239,23-1-1032,00.html">great talks</a><span style="font-weight:bold;"><a href="http://lds.org/conference/sessions/display/0,5239,23-1-1032,00.html"></a></span></span>. I especially enjoyed Elder Robert D. Hales' talk on <a href="http://lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,23-1-1032-2,00.html">becoming provident providers temporally and spiritually</a>. It goes along with my life motto to simplify.		</p>

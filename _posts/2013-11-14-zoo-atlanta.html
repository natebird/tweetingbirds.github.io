<p>Nate has been over working himself with overtime at his regular job then coming home to work until midnight or so doing side jobs. Both jobs have been extremely stressful with lots of deadlines. And on top of all that he still does his fatherly duties and church calling. And there are a few other emotional stresses going on with his family. There were weeks where the girls would only see him on the weekends. He was here, just at work until after they would go to bed. This working long hours thing started around June, got better around September but we were traveling most of that month. Then got busy again in October and carrying on to November. There were times where we did FaceTime just to the girls could see Nate even though he was only an hour away at work. </p>
<p>I had him take a day off from work and just have some fun with the family.The girls had a furlough day from school on election day so that morning I took my glucose test. Nate did a few things around the house that had been on his to do list. Then I had set up a massage appointment for him. This was his first time getting a massage. He thoroughly enjoyed it. Then we headed off to the zoo with the girls. It was so nice because the zoo wasn't crowded. We used the library zoo pass so we didn't have to pay admissions. It was a great day.</p>

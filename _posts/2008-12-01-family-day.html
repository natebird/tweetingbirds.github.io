				We don't get Nate time very often anymore. He didn't even take a day off the Friday after Thanksgiving, he worked a full day. So since we had Nate around Saturday without any major plans, we made it a fun family day.</p>
<p>Nate began the day by making daddy's special puffed up pancakes. Delicious!</p>
<p>Then, Kenzie had some daddy play time. They played a game that Kenzie invented and named San Diego. To play, you keep the balloon in the air by hitting it.</p>
<p>Next, we made handprint Christmas trees. Kenzie picked out everyone's tree colors.</p>
<p>After Kenzie's quiet/nap time, we went over to my parents' house. It was a wonderful family day!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/STRYrAELT0I/AAAAAAAADxg/U97QYw0dhB8/s1600-h/IMG_9407.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9407.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274938559332831042" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/STRYqy9lWiI/AAAAAAAADxY/fH_QoJTs9ZE/s1600-h/IMG_9406.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9406.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274938555815516706" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/STRYqmGP5LI/AAAAAAAADxQ/WN6KDtgGx9w/s1600-h/IMG_9405.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9405.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5274938552362198194" /></a>		</p>

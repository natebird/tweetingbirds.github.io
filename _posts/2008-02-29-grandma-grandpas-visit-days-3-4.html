				Day 3 of Grandma and Grandpa's visit, we went shoe shopping early in the day. Nate took the day off work and we all did some shopping in the shoe stores they don't have in Washington. Then, we went over to my parents' for a yummy Chinese dinner.</p>
<p>Today, Day 4, we went to the aquarium for 4 hours earlier in the day. The weather was beautiful, sunny and warm. We toured around the aquarium looking at all the amazing displays of fish, otters, whales, rays, eels, sharks, and so much more. We took over 100 photos at the aquarium... I picked a few good ones to post.</p>
<p>After the aquarium, we headed back home where Randy and Nate tacked some house projects. We put up my new track light fixture in the kitchen, and put the fluorescent kitchen light in the garage. It brought much improvements to both rooms. Next, was the entertainment center that is going to be painted black. It's a large oak entertainment center we received a year ago from someone moving out-of-state. But the light and the entertainment center required another trip to Home Depot and Duron for more supplies and missing equipment to tackle the tasks.</p>
<p>We spent the rest of the night putting the primer on the entertainment center while Cyndi watched and played with Kenzie. It was amazing how much we were able to get done without Kenzie hugging our legs or wanting us to play with her.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8sPBdfuXjI/AAAAAAAABgU/Ib0k80AD2NU/s1600-h/IMG_7463.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7463.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5173245114737122866" /></a><br />Dinner at my parents' house on Friday night.

				We had been looking into getting a nicer vacuum (Dyson) or the Roomba. We found a deal on Woot for the Roomba. And it vacuums on its own where as a Dyson someone would have to push it. We decided to give the Roomba a try. Everyone I know who had a Roomba all love it. </p>
<p>It was hilarious though. Nate got so excited about it once we got it because it's a robot. He was giddy like a little school girl, especially when he found out the controller can tell it where to go. He was even chasing the girls around the house with it. They were scared of it at first, now they think it is pretty fun. </p>
<p>It has worked out really nice for us though. It took some learning to get it to do what we wanted it to do, or go where we wanted it to go. We still sweep the dining room because the kids get lots of food under there, some stuff that's still wet. And it can't get between the legs of our chairs. It can vacuum hardwood, tile, and carpet. We have it set to vacuum in the middle of the night and in the mornings, I come down to a nice clean floor. It's amazing the stuff it picks up. Our girls get food and stuff all over the carpets each day. We still need a regular vacuum, but this does a pretty good day-to-day job.  </p>
<p>This is the reason why we bought the Roomba. Our floors look like this each day.</p>

<p>
				I haven't said much about the pregnancy because there's not much to tell. So just a quick overview of my second pregnancy experience and status update.
<ul>
<li>I am at 34 weeks, only 1 1/2 month left to go.</li>
<li>My due date is still Jan. 30. The doctor did say he won't let me go past due date.</li>
<li>I have gained 19.5 lbs thus far, that half of what I had with Kenzie this far along.</li>
<li>Laney is no longer breeched and has flipped head down.</li>
<li>Laney hasn't "dropped," but she is hanging out really low. I don't think there will be much room for "dropping" when it comes time.</li>
<li>Laney is extremely active, always kicking, punching, moving, or having hiccups.</li>
<li>My stomach is getting bigger, meaning I am getting uncomfortable with sleep, getting up and down, and leaning forward (a little front heavy).</li>
<li>I have done nothing to prepare for Laney's arrival other than picked out a name and purchasing diapers on sale.</li>
<li>My gestational diabetes is going well. I have it pretty much under control as long I as manage my food intake.</li>
<li>I am not ready for Laney to get here. Right now, my thoughts are, "She is much easier to take care of inside than out- automatic feeding, cleaning, and sleeping. Once she is out, I'll have to do all the feeding, cleaning, and putting her to sleep."</li>
<li>I am measuring normal, whatever that means. I guess the baby is at the right size for her age.</li>
<li>To my dismay, I have been craving chocolate. It is so weird for someone who absolutely hates the taste of chocolate! I still don't like the taste of chocolate, but it fulfills my cravings. This is the first time I have had chocolate in probably 13 years. I even ate brownies, and the smell of brownies used to make me gag.</li>
<li>Kenzie is excited to be a big sister. She knows what is going on, but I don't think she understands the extent of intrusiveness Laney will be in her life. She still says Laney is in her belly and mommy's sister is in my belly.</li>
<li>Everyone please pray for my water to break or the doctor inducing me on Jan. 16, so Nate won't have to miss too many classes with the baby's birth. That's MLK weekend.</li>
</ul>

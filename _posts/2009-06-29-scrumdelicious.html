<p>
				Last Friday I started Laney on solids, more like liquid rice cereal on a spoon. She turned 5 months on Sunday. She took it well. At first her tongue didn't know what to do, but she quickly learned to swallow it.
<div></div>
<div>She had been sleeping 9-10 hours before. But that night, after having solids for lunch and dinner, she slept from 7 p.m. to 3:45 a.m. I let her whine and fell back asleep at 4:30 then slept until 8:45. We had to wake her up at 8:45 because I was leaving for the youth temple trip at 9, or else she would have slept longer. </div>
<div></div>
<div>Speaking of sleep, she likes to sleep on her tummy. We put her in bed on her back, but she quickly flips over to her tummy. I tried to turn her back over but it disturbed her sleep then got mad and flipped back onto her tummy. She tosses and turns in her sleep like her mom. </div>

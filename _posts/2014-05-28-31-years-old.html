				My birthday was on a Saturday this year. That morning I had to go up to Jasper to do interviews and take pictures of the stake youth activity for my calling. When I got back, we ate lunch, went to a French bakery to pick up some macarons. Then we took the kids to Cold Stone for ice cream. That's what I wanted instead of a cake. It was a nice, calm birthday. I just enjoy spending it with the family.</p>

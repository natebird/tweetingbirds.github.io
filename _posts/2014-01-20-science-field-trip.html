				Kenzie had an in-house field trip right before Christmas break. They hired a company that had a lady come in to each about matter. They had four different stations to rotate and learn different things about matter. Kenzie loved it. I was able to go in to take pictures of this too. </p>
<p>Then she got sick on Wednesday before break with a slight fever. The school nurse called and she came home early. By then I just kept her out of school the rest of the days because I didn't want her to pick up something else at school and give her some time to recover from her cold. She missed Polar Express day and exchanging treats and notes with her classmates and making a snowman with a tube sock filled with rice. But we did our own Polar Express day at home in our pjs, popcorn, and hot cocoa. </p>

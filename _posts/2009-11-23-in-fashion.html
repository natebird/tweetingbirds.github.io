<p>Kenzie has always had an opinion about the clothes she wears. And now that she is old enough and tall enough, she can get change clothes whenever she wants and wear whatever she wants. This is one area I am not going to restrict within reasonable limits. Nate is the modesty police in our family. So Kenzie's clothes have to be at least modest. And I have to talk her out of wearing summer clothes in the winter, even if it is warm in our house. But other than that, she can wear anything her heart so desires. A couple weeks ago, she decided to wear her tutu under her skirt like a petticoat. She is so stylish.</p>

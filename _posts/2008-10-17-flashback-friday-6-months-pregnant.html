I was huge- especially since she was a 9 pound baby. This was around Easter time.</p>
<p>Me in the brown- Current picture of me at the beginning of my 6th month with our second child. A bit smaller this time around. I, surprisingly, haven't been gaining as much weight this time around as I had with Kenzie. I made the switch to maternity clothes last month. I'm still trying to squeeze into my regular church clothes on Sundays. Of course, I had a few extra pounds left over from Kenzie for this child already in store.</p>

				I am scheduled to be induced tomorrow. So here's my last day as mom of 3 girls. I am more than excited to get this baby out of me. I have been having contractions sporadically throughout the day but nothing consistent to head to the hospital. I was hoping she would come earlier, but it's going to work out great for her to come tomorrow. </p>
<p>I was able to set up for the girls to go to mom and dad's to spend the night tonight and maybe even while we are at the hospital. It depends on how my mom can handle the girls and what Nate wants to do. Mom just had a chemo treatment last Friday and her first week is always the hardest. So I'm not sure how long she can last handling 3 girls. Right now we are just planning on evaluating day by day. Nate goes home each night to sleep so he could pick up the girls if they don't want to spend the night or if it's too much for mom to handle. </p>
<p>I was also able also set up some special stuff for the girls. I made packages for each day they will be gone for them to open. Each package has something fun for them to do at my parents' house to keep them busy - play dough, watercolor, and stamps and stickers. I also set up some activities for Nate to do with the girls next week while he takes care of them and as I adjust to having a newborn. </p>
<p>And I am also glad it's Wednesday because my favorite midwife from my OB office will be there that day. She delivered Kenzie and Laney. It'll be good to have her with the last kid. </p>
<p>And Nate was also able to go into the office today to get some things done and meet with his boss. He says he is going to take off a week when the baby is here. We'll see about that.</p>

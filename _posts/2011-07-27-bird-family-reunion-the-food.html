				Oh my gosh. It was a week of delicious food at the Bird house. Incredible. Nate's mom was amazing with all the preparation and meal planning. There was not a day where any of the 24 people in the house went hungry. In fact, I think we all over ate. Let's just start with the cherries. Aahh. I miss the cherries. They were so delicious, plump and juicy. The cherries came late this year so we got there just in time. In one day, they picked over 20 gallons of cherries from their back yard. That's several hundred dollars worth of cherries. All the other days they just picked enough to eat for the day. Can you imagine fresh fruit every morning? It was heavenly.</p>

<p>They washed the cherries and then pitted them to freeze. They use them later for pies or smoothies or whatever.</p>

<p>Then there was the raspberries. Nate's dad's favorite fruit is raspberries and they have several rows of raspberry bushes in their garden. Each morning they would go and pick raspberries for breakfast. I love raspberries too so I was enjoying every bit of it. I ate raspberries with just about everything. I love a house with fresh fruit everywhere and you can walk through the kitchen anytime and grab a handful of fruit to eat. Yummy.</p>

<p>We also made lots of snacks and desserts. Yeah, amazing that I didn't gain 10 pounds on this trip. Here's Michelle and her fiancé making cookies…</p>

<p>Here's Grandma and Grandpa making salad one night to go with the pizzas…</p>

<p>Kids of all ages enjoyed the meals, including NJ here…</p>

<p>The kitchen was never empty and everyone did their part to pitch in to cook or clean…</p>

<p>Nate's dad is the breakfast guy. He loves making breakfast for everyone. He has done it since the children were young and he hasn't stopped. In the mornings we would fill up on pancakes, parfaits, oatmeal, cereal and a ton of fruits.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4250" title="IMG_8199 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8199.jpg" alt="" width="385" height="550" /></p>
<p>Kenzie was in heaven because she loves breakfasts, especially pancakes.</p>

<p>Sunday's meal was a show stopper. Since we were all in church from 9 a.m. to 12 p.m., Nate's mom had Sunday's meal worked out with a friend who had church at a different time. The friend and a crew of people put together over 150 shrimp, beef and chicken kabobs. Then there were delicious sides of beans, potato salads, salads and four different kinds of amazing desserts. There were so much food that some of us were eating kabobs that evening and the next couple of days.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4246" title="IMG_8010 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8010.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4247" title="IMG_8162 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8162.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>

<p>And our last night there Nate's dad smoked six huge racks of baby back ribs for six hours. It was melting off the bones. So sad to have to come home to my cooking.</p>

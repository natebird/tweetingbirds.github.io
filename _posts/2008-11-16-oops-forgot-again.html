				Another week without a Flashback Friday and I just noticed right now, Sunday at 9:04 p.m. Where have my mind been? I don't know. I am at that stage of pregnancy where I am overly spacey and clumsy. I am dropping things left and right several times.</p>
<p>Today, on our way out the door to visit Scott and Stacey (uncle and auntie), I asked Nate as we were getting in the car…</p>
<p>Tiffany: Did you get the house key?<br />Nate: Yes, you gave it to me just a few minutes ago.<br />Tiffany: Did I really? Because I do remember thinking I should probably get the keys but I don't remember actually giving it to you.<br />Nate: I remember watching you handing me the keys.<br />Tiffany: Oh.</p>
<p>And this week, Nate and I haven't seen much of each other at all, even less than usual.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Monday:</span> Nate had school and stayed after to meet with his group for a project.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tuesday:</span> I had an OB appointment then ran errands. Nate had school that evening and came home late again for another group project.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Wednesday:</span> I had a presidency meeting with YW. I didn't have mutual that evening, but Nate went to the church to play basketball.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Thursday:</span> I had my glucose test for 3 hours. I ran errands. Nate had school in the evening. And he had a conference call with classmates when he got home. Some of the sisters in the ward came over to do a run through of the tile boards for the holiday workshop.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Friday:</span> I ran more errands all day. Nate said we couldn't do anything but stay home and watch a movie this evening. It was our first family night in a long time.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday: </span> I was at the church from 7:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. with the Relief Society Holiday Workshop. I came home and was just exhausted from standing up that whole time. My parents came over for dinner and hung out in the evening.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday:</span> I was at the church from 7:20 a.m. to 1:45 p.m. for church and three meetings. Then we went over to Scott and Stacey's house.</p>
<p>Oh, how I miss Nate!		</p>

<p>
				Kenzie was tested back in March for the gifted program. We finally got the results of her tests last Friday. She did average in one and above average in the other. There are still two more parts of this process to find out whether she is eligible for the gifted program or not. One of which is an interview and the second is a creativity test that will be done in August. I'm not sure why it takes them so long to figure out if they are gifted or not. But that's besides the point.</p>
<p>Kenzie had her interview with the gifted teacher last Friday. Later when I was asking her about what they asked her, she could only remember one question the teacher asked her.</p>
<p>Tiffany: What kind of questions did she [the teacher] ask you?</p>
<p>Kenzie: We just talked about me so she can get to know me better.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Do you remember any of the questions she asked you?</p>
<p>Kenzie: She asked me," If my teacher could teach me anything, what would I want to learn?" I said economics because I don't know anything about economics. She asked me what else I wanted to learn besides economics. I said I wanted to know why are our shadows black.</p>
<p>That just made Nate so happy. Nate was an economics major at BYU.		</p>

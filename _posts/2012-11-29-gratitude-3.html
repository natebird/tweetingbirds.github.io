				There are so many things to be grateful for this year. I meant to post this on Thanksgiving but it has been crazy here and I didn't finish the post in time. But I didn't want to let the year slip by without counting our blessings.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nate's job.</strong> Having been unemployed for two years, every year Nate has a job I am grateful for it. And he has a great job with enough pay to provide for the needs of our family. And he has been working so hard doing stuff on the side to bring in extra money so we can pay off school loans. And he's so good at what he does.</li>
<li><strong>Our house.</strong> I love our house. It's getting a bit too cozy for the 5 of us, mostly lack of storage space. But it's such a great house and I especially love the location. It's so close to everything. I've lived in this house the longest of all the house in my life.</li>
<li><strong>Kenzie.</strong> She is such a good kid and does what she is supposed to. So blessed to have her who makes being a mom a little easier.</li>
<li><strong>Laney.</strong> She makes me laugh. She is the fun in my life. We have a great time together.</li>
<li><strong>Lai Lai.</strong> She is simply adorable and so smart for her age. I'm impressed with her ability to comprehend the stuff happening around her and the things we say.</li>
<li><strong>My parents.</strong> They are amazing people and help me with so much with the kids.</li>
<li><strong>Nate's parents.</strong> I love them. They are such great example to me.</li>
<li><strong>Vacations.</strong> We have been blessed where we have had opportunities to go on vacations this year. Nate and I love to travel and we love taking our children along so they can see the world.</li>
<li><strong>Roomba.</strong> Nate's favorite thing. I have never seen him act like this before, giddy like a little school girl. It's hilarious. Yeah, I like the Roomba. It helps us keep the floors clean because we pick up stuff every night because we know it's going to go off that night and we don't want it to suck up big things or get stuck somewhere. And it's also good at vacuuming all the crumbs and stuff the girls leave behind. Every morning our house is pretty clean. I love it. But my favorite thing about the Roomba is watching Nate's reaction to it. He loves to watch it go around the house. He loves that it's a robot. He loves that it had a controller and he can tell it where to go. He's just so fascinated by it.</li>
<li><strong>Friends.</strong> This year we lost a great friend, Barron Smith. We still miss him like crazy. He's a great example of a the truest friend. And along with Barron, we have so many other great friends in our lives. We have been so blessed.</li>
</ul>

				Kenzie has been suffering from a cold (runny nose and cough) for the last two weeks. It has been concerning me since Saturday because her colds do not usually last this long. Then Saturday night, she had a little temperature of 99.9 degrees which Tylenol took care of quickly. And she kept sticking her finger in her left ear. When I asked her if her ear hurt, she responded, "Itchy." We kept her home from church on Sunday because the night before she woke up at 4 a.m. coughing up a lung. I stayed up with her until about 4:30 a.m. when we got her cough under control.</p>
<p>I had called her pediatrician office talking to a nurse last Friday asking what I can do to help Kenzie's cough and runny nose. She said to just run a humidifier and use saline nose drops since all OTC cough and cold medicine had been recalled. It seemed like it was just a cold because Kenzie was still her cheery self and acting normal with occasional cough, sneezing, and runny nose.</p>
<p>However, my mind just won't let it rest. With our trip in a little bit, I didn't want to risk having her conditions worsen while we were away from her pediatrician. So this morning, I decided I would set up an appointment with her pediatrician for today to have her checked out. I just wanted to know what it was and how to take care of it. We were lucky to set an appointment at 10:30 a.m. He checked her out and discovered a bit of an ear infection in the left ear and bronchitis. He prescribed a strong antibiotic that doesn't need to be refrigerated to help with the travel, and an antihistamine to help with the cough. And now, $100 in medical bills and Rx later, I have a peace of mind knowing that Kenzie will get better soon.</p>
<p>A funny story, while in the MD office, the patient room was decorated in Winnie the Pooh characters and the words "100 Acre Woods" taped to the walls. Kenzie loved it because she knew all the characters names despite the fact that she has never seen the show. She learned them from her books and flash cards. While the doctor was writing up her prescriptions, Kenzie read the letters to "Acre Woods" by saying "A-C-R-E-double (for W)-D and two Os." Her doctor was so impressed with how smart she was in her ability to read and communicate as Kenzie talked on and on about Winnie the Pooh.</p>
<p>And Nate just called me asking me to get him from work because he has a fever and not feeling good. Great! I have two sick people to take care of, A LOT of packing, laundry, cleaning, and organizing drop-off and pick-up to and from the airport before our trip. Wish me luck!		</p>

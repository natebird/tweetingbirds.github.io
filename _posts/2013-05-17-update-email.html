				This was an email I sent out to family…</p>
<p>It's been a while. I thought we would do a little update. Maybe that would encourage you to do an update so we know what's going on in your family! It's the crazy time of year where everything happens all at once. Birthdays, end of the school year, anniversary, and summer. So here's a little of what we have been up to…</p>
<p><strong>Nate…</strong> Got back from a week in Portland and Wenatchee. He was in Portland for Rails Conf and since he was so close to Washington, he flew up to Wenatchee for Friday and Saturday to spend with mom and dad. He loved every second of it. He got them all to himself. The last time that happened was before Nick was born. He got them all new techie stuff (Apple, of course) and updated their techie stuff. And hiked Saddle Rock with them, and partied with the empty nesters and ate like a king. Besides work and a few side jobs, he is part of a new company we are starting, TOM (Tough Old Men) with a few other people. It was an idea that our friend Barron had for years and now that Barron has passed, we are trying to make it happen. He also had a birthday where he turned 33. Where he got to spend with the people who brought him to this earth. He loved it!</p>
<p><strong>Tiffany…</strong> I am busy volunteering at school for all the end-of-the-year stuff happening this week and next week (field day, end-of-the-year party, movie day, awards day). I am also getting the girls set up for summer with swim lessons and play dates with friends. And running the girls to dance classes and rehearsals. My blog has taken a back seat as I am so busy doing other stuff (service, checking on Irene each day, doing a few shirt designs for various events, etc.). It is also harder to keep up with blogging as the girls get older and more involved in everything. But I absolutely love doing the mom thing and being involved in their lives and the things they are doing. I know it won't be like this forever so I am enjoying it while I can. I am also part of this TOM businesses. Lots of work getting things started and ready for our first event on the 25th. And my calling also takes me to several stake meetings and interviews and such. Pretty interesting. I am still working out a few times a week and trying to get in shape. I've lost about 20 pounds which got me to my weight before I had kids. Yay! Just in time to turn 30. Yikes! Turning 30 was a rough one for me. I still haven't come to terms with it. Maybe when I turn 40 will I appreciate being 30. :)</p>
<p><strong>Kenzie (6)…</strong> Next Wednesday is her last day in 1st grade. Kenzie is sad, but I cannot wait for school to end! She had such a wonderful year learning. Her teacher was amazing and did really well keeping Kenzie challenged at her level. She is gaining such great experiences at school learning to make good friends, learning life lessons, learning to work with others, and learning to be a good sport in various situations. She is tall and skinny. Finding clothes that actually fits is pretty much impossible. She is a speed reader. At the beginning of 1st grade she was reading 180 words per minute. Now she is doing 197 wpm. She is doing jazz, tap, and ballet in dance. We are thinking of maybe having her start competition dance next year. We'll see. She loves dance! She is really responsible and obedient. We are so blessed to have her as our oldest as she is a good example to her sisters. They adore her.</p>
<p><strong>Laney (4)…</strong> Still the spunk in our family. I weaned her from sucking on her thumb shortly after she turned 4 this year. She did it so gracefully. We were all shocked! Since she stopped sucking on her thumb, she started taking and singing more. She says the funniest things and has quite the vocabulary. She loves being in primary (Sunbeams) and loves her primary teacher. She has learned to read the alphabet and working on writing. She can write the names of all the people in our family (something she has been working on for a while). She also loves to count and make up numbers. I had her evaluated for speech therapy and she did qualify for therapy starting next school year at Kenzie's school. I am hoping it will help her to speak clearly before she starts kindergarten in another year (2014). She loves dance too. She is learning ballet and tap this year. It's her favorite thing each week. She is also really smart. She loves to play with Legos and Lego Duplos. She can build incredible things without instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Lai Lai (20m)…</strong> Not a baby anymore. So sad. She does everything she can to keep up with her sisters. She is quite good at it too. She is also talking up a storm saying over 100 words and putting words together to form sentences. I'm afraid she is also really intelligent. With the skills of all three girls combined, they will one day rule the world. I just hope I am on their good side when that happens. She runs everywhere, goes up and down the stairs by herself, buckles herself into her car seat, and has taken on dancing like her sisters. She has some great moves! Her personality is a mix of both Laney and Kenzie's. Heavily influenced by Laney though because that's the sister she loves to follow around and is with majority of the day. The problem is she thinks she is 4 and acts like it too. She loves her stuffed bear, Emma, and her baby dolls. She takes care of them and plays with them all day.</p>
<p><strong>As a family…</strong> As you have heard, we have been talking about moving. Still don't know where or when. We are still looking at options. Nate and I have our 9th anniversary tomorrow. I love being married to him! And every day it's such a fun adventure together. We have been so blessed with such beautiful and wonderful girls. And we have good friends and family. So blessed in so many ways.		</p>

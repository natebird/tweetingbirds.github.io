				For Family Home Evening Monday night, I helped Kenzie make a count down chain to Thanksgiving. I asked her for 24 things she was thankful for to write one on each of the chain links. Here were some cute ones she came up with all on her own.</p>
<p>I am thankful for my doctor. He help fix me.<br />I am thankful for the kitchen.<br />I am thankful for the TV.<br />I am thankful for my table (in her playroom).<br />I am thankful for yellow.<br />I am thankful for thunder.<br />I am thankful for paper.<br />I am thankful for crayons.</p>
<p>Then there were the usual: Mommy, Daddy, Puo Puo, Dudepa, Jeffrey, GG, Great Grandpa, Grandma, Grandpa, Elmo, Baby Bop, Barney, and toys.		</p>

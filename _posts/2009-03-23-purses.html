We did a purse theme for "Purse"uing Virtue" to introduce the new YW value. As gifts, I made the girls these cute paper purses and filled it with goodies to remind them to pursue virtue in their daily lives. It was a big hit.</p>
<p>By request, I also made more cream puffs for part of the refreshments at New Beginnings. This time I tripled the batch to make sure we had enough.</p>
<p>Lastly, I put together a Question Jar for YW. Each Sunday, rather than doing a spotlight since we only have 9 active girls now, we have a girl pick a random question to answer about herself during opening exercises. It's a fun way to get to know each of our girls a little better. I forgot to take a picture of the question jar. It was an empty peanut butter plastic jug with colorful slips of paper inside. Then I slapped a cute Question Jar label on the outside. Anyone interested in doing this same idea for your YW, let me know. I have over 150 random questions I can email you for the jar.</p>
<p>I'm glad that New Beginnings is over. We a few calmer months coming up with Girls Camp pre-certifications. I was able to cancel some presidency and class presidency meetings for the next couple of months. Yay!		</p>

				It was a nice spring day a few weeks ago and I wanted some sunshine so I took the girls to the park after school. Nate was working late that day so we just hung out for a bit at the park. It was still a little windy but the sun made it really nice. It was perfect because the bugs and pollen didn't start yet. The girls had fun. Then after we got back from our trip all the pollen came down and everything was yellow. Yuck. Even though it was nice weather, you can't even have the window open without sucking in a cloud of pollen. Then we got some cold chills in the middle of that. I hope that kills all the mosquitoes. Such weird weather this winter and spring. </p>

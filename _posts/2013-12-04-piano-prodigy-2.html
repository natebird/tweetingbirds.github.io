<p>This girl is quite the piano prodigy. She has already gone through her first set of piano books after three months of lessons. Her piano teacher Ms. Hill said Kenzie is the perfect student. She loves teaching her. She picks up piano pretty quickly. She is learning to read notes and playing with both hands. We bought her a second set of books and she has jumped right in. And we had also bought her some simplified Children's Primary Songbook songs when we were in Washington's Deseret Books and she is playing those on her own. She loves learning to play the piano and I hope she doesn't ever lose that love. I can listen to her play all day. And I hope this also instills a desire in her sisters to want to play also.</p>

<p>While Kenzie is in piano lesson, we wait out in the van. It's only a half hour lesson which doesn't really leave us enough time to run any errands or go anywhere. So the other two girls and I just wait in the van for her to finish. The other day Laney found a friend while wandering around Ms. Hill's front yard.</p>

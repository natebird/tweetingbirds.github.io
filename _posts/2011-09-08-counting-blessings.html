<p>
				We have so much to be grateful for even though there are a lot of crazies going on now.</p>
<ul>
<li>Great doctors who are thorough.</li>
<li>Doctor friends who let you call them any time.</li>
<li>Supportive friends &amp; family.</li>
<li>An amazing husband who is super helpful with the children and around the house.</li>
<li>The priesthood and the power of the priesthood. Nate was able to give both me and Lai Lai a blessing.</li>
<li>Friends who called because they were concerned with how we are doing and about Lai Lai's heart condition.</li>
<li>People in the ward who brought us meals the first few days after returning from the hospital. That was so good not having to worry about cooking. I need more of that.</li>
<li>Sleep at night. For the most part, Lai Lai sleeps pretty well at night. It's just the 3 hour feedings that's killing me. It could be worst.</li>
<li>My in-laws are coming during Kenzie's fall break later this month. I can't wait for them to be here. They are always such great help after I have a baby.</li>
<li>Increase in milk. At least I can feed Lai Lai mostly with nursing and only have to supplement 1-2 ounces of formula.</li>
<li>Knowing other people with 3+ kids. It's comforting to know that they've been through what I'm going through and are still alive.</li>
<li>Nate's job. Even though we found out that the baby is going to cost way more than we had anticipated, we are glad that Nate has a job so we can pay our bills. And his job is flexible where he can set his own hours and work from home some times.</li>
</ul>

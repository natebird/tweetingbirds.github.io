<p>Laney has picked up this habit of <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/04/she-found-her-thumb/">thumb sucking</a>. Many kids do it. That's fine. I don't mind other mothers letting their kids suck on their thumbs or pacifiers. I personally have a hard time with it. But that's just me. Laney does it when she is tired because it helps her to fall asleep, it's a sleep prop.</p>

<p>I've heard it all before… "How could you take away her comfort?" "I can still remember the feeling I had when I sucked my thumb as a child." "My child sucked his thumb until he went to school and he didn't need braces." I know, I'm a horrible mother for taking away something that comforts my child. Let me explain my reasonings and maybe you will ease up on your judgement of me as a mother.
<ul>
<li>I want Laney to learn to fall asleep on her own without any sleep props. I am a total believer of that. We did it with Kenzie and she has been a great sleeper ever since she learned to fall asleep on her own. And it's not just the initial falling asleep when you first put them down. Everyone "wakes up" a few times as part of the sleep cycle and babies who don't learn to fall back asleep themselves actually wakes up out of their sleep cycles. </li>
<li>If Laney uses thumb sucking to fall back asleep, then it will be harder to break her out of that habit when she gets older. What would we do? Strap her arms down?</li>
<li>Laney doesn't nurse well when she sucks on her thumb. She has a hard time latching on when nursing. Then she gets extremely hungry and angry. </li>
<li>Prevention of future oral problems of overbites and teeth alignments. </li>
<li>The germs. Yes, I'm somewhat OCD and a germaphobe. </li>
</ul>

<p>This whole process of breaking this habit at such a young age has not been easy. All the comments I receive from people certainly doesn't help. There have been many times when I almost gave up. She <i>is</i> cute when she sticks that thumb in there with the other four fingers fanned out. It <i>is</i> hard taking away something that makes her quiet and happy. And it <i>is</i> heart breaking to listen to her cry about it. I feel like such a mean mom.</p>

<p>Although, from this experience she has earned the nickname Little Houdini. That first night, about 2 1/2 months ago, I heard Laney sucking on her thumb through the baby monitor, I asked Nate to check on her. He wouldn't believe that I could hear Laney sucking on her thumb. Sure enough, when he went in there to check on her, she was doing it. So he put her arms down next to her and tucked her in tightly with her blanket. A few minutes later, she got out of that.</p>
<p>I went in next to swaddle her with the blanket with her arms tucked in tightly. She used her legs to kick the blanket loose, then got her hand out. It only took her a few minutes. That's when Nate came up with the idea to put sock on her hands.</p>

<p>In the beginning, we only put a sock on the right hand because that's the thumb she sucked on. Well, she turned ambidextrous on us. Next we put socks on both hands. It took her a couple days to figure out how to take them off, behind our backs. At first, Nate and I thought the other person took off the socks. When we asked each other, we finally figured out that she has been taking them off on her own except neither one of us had seen her do it. After a while, we caught her in the act. She had two methods. Use the other hand to pull it off, even if the other hand was gloved. Or use her mouth to pull it off her hands. Now, she can take the sock gloves off her hands faster than we can put it on her. And she gives an adorable mischievous smile of satisfaction and accomplishment each time.</p>
<p>Then Nate and I made some arm cuffs out of an oatmeal tube to put over her elbows so she can bend it to suck on her thumb. That was the most heart breaking and felt inhumane. As her mother, I couldn't keep that up. I took a picture of it, but I don't even have the heart to look at it, it was that sad.</p>

<p>Our newest trick is an 18-month size long sleeve onsie with the ends of the sleeves sewn shut. Yup, Little Houdini hasn't been able to get out of that and it has been four nights now. We only put it on her when she sleeps at night as her pajamas. At nap time, we s<br />
till use the sock trick. She has been falling asleep and napping for about 1 1/2-2 hours with the socks on. But toward the end of her naps, she takes them off and have at her thumb. That's when we try to intervene.</p>
<p>At bedtimes, the oversized onsie has been working. The first night, I got no sleep. She woke up at 1 a.m. then again at 6 a.m. I went in and nursed her at those times. Mind you, she had been sleeping through the night, 10 hours straight, when she sucked on her thumb. The second night, she woke up at 1 a.m. again. I let her whine/cry for about 2 hours before going in to nurse her. The third night she woke up at 3 a.m.- whined, cried, slept, whined, cried for 2 hours then I went in to nurse her. The fourth night, she woke up at 3 a.m.- whined, cried for about an hour then slept until 6. I think it's getting better night by night.</p>
<p>Nate has been great supporting me in this endeavor. We are on the same page when it comes to training babies to sleep as we both value our sleep greatly. Kenzie has also been a help as she keeps watch on her baby sister and tells her not to suck on her thumb. She also assists in pulling the thumb out when we catch Laney sucking away.</p>

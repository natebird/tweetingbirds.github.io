<p>Our first Halloween together, my friend, Julia and her husband, Josh, put together a murder mystery at their apartment for Halloween. None of us were big into Halloween so this was our alternative. Josh and Julia rented a murder mystery from a game store. We dressed up for the murder mystery, had dinner, and had a great time visiting with each other. The other couple in the picture was Julia's brother, Adam and his at the time girlfriend, now wife, Shalona. Great times!		</p>

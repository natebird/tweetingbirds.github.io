				Kenzie's class at school was blessed to have a student teacher most of the first semester. Mrs. Katie Hopkins was so awesome. She is super nice and helped a lot with the class. The kids all loved her. Her last day was at the beginning of December and so many of the kids were so sad to see her leave. Kenzie's teacher, Mrs. Wilson threw a surprise party for Mrs. Hopkins and I was there to take pictures. Kenzie has been lucky so far in having amazing teachers at her school. I hope it stays that way.</p>

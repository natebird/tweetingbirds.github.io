				These girls are all about dressing up and wearing skirts every day. They both have a fit if they only have pants left to wear. Yesterday, I was supposed to do laundry but we ended up going to my parents' instead. And all that was left in their dressers were pants. So they wore Sunday dresses to my parents' house because there was no way they could wear jeans or pants without skirts. They are definitely princesses.</p>

				OK, yeah. I'm still posting about Christmas. That's because we got snow this year. It was the third recorded time of having accumulated snow on Christmas day since 1880s. Church even cancelled on Sunday (Christmas was on Saturday this year) because of the road conditions. We weren't sure if we could get out of neighborhood because of the hills.</p>
<p>It started snowing Christmas day around 11 a.m. It didn't stop snowing until the next day. It was awesome. We got about 2-3 inches of this white stuff. The girls had such a fun time playing the snow.</p>

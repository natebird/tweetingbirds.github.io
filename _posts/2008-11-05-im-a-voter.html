				Yup, I earned my voter sticker yesterday, well, actually Kenzie took my sticker before I even had a chance to wear it. It was a momentous occasion as it was my first time voting at a presidential election, too bad we didn't have better candidates. It came down to picking the best of two evils in my opinion. But it was still pretty nice to know that I made my contribution.</p>
<p>Yesterday began with story time at the library. Kenzie loved it and enjoyed stories having to do with nursery rhymes that she was familiar with from her books at home. Next, we made the trip to the elementary school to vote. And then, it was off to a busy day (all day) at the grocery store for me as I tried to figure out the best deals and then coupon those deals with a toddler in tow. It eventually took two trips, but I ended up coming home with three grocery carts full of food (some was for food storage) - 195 items, spent $205.87, but saved $188.04 with coupons and store deals. Not too bad. That's 48% worth of savings. Enough said.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SREKy42ingI/AAAAAAAACuA/HZSM3uzj3fo/s1600-h/42-18564551.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 214px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/42-18564551.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5265001308743704066" /></a>		</p>

				I have been dying being stuck inside the house all day long. I feel like Kenzie has been bored doing the same things everyday. It's just so hot outside with 100 degree humid weather. And I can't stand the heat being pregnant and all. I'm just glad this time I'm not 9 months pregnant in the summer. But unless you get outside before 8 a.m., you're swimming in humidity. And Kenzie and I are late sleepers - around 8:30 or 9 a.m. Also, without a second car and money to go out to do stuff, Kenzie and I have turned into hermits.</p>
<p>I am looking for people with ideas of toddler activity ideas! Anything! Today, Kenzie and I made a tent and had a tea party for her animals in the tent. A couple days ago, we made a fishing pond out of a shoe box and had her fish for alphabet fish. Yesterday, we made sugar cookies with cookie shapes. Still a few more months until the weather will cool off enough for us to go outside -- any ideas people?</p>

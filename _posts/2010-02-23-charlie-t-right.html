				Charlie T. Right was a guest in our home for two weeks. He is a CTR bear that the primary kids pass around. He helps the kids choose the right. There is also a little get to know you sheet each kid fills out for primary to get to know them a little better. We had him for two weeks because of stake conference. Kenzie slept with it everything night.</p>
<p>When we first brought him home, I had Kenzie take Charlie upstairs to show him her room. When I came into her room later to check on her, this was what I found. And empty canvas bag on the floor (the bag that Charlie came in).</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">I asked her where Charlie was. She said, "In my basket. He's tired. So he'll sleep there for two weeks."</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Needless to say, he didn't stay in the basket for two weeks. She actually grown quiet fond of Charlie. But we had to give him back. Not before we got some pictures of the two of them.</div>

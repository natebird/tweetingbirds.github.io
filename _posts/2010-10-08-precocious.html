<p>Kenzie has been using big words in her daily language since she was about 2 1/2 years old. Here are some big words she has been using and she uses them correctly.</p>
<ul>
<li>precocious</li>
<li>diabolical</li>
<li>herbivore</li>
<li>omnivore</li>
<li>carnivore</li>
<li>nocturnal</li>
<li>apetite</li>
<li>articulate</li>
<li>metamorphosis</li>
<li>humungous</li>
</ul>
<p>She also knows a lot of dinosaur names from the show Dinosaur Train.</p>
<p>Kenzie has also been working on memorizing her <a href="http://scriptures.lds.org/en/a_of_f/1" target="_blank">Articles of Faith</a>. She has 1 through 4 down. She is working on the 5th one. It started out as a joke. Over the summer Nate didn't have class on Mondays. We were able to have Family Home Evening again with him. I jokingly said, "Now that you're home, you can be in charge of FHE." He responded, "That's fine. We'll do the Articles of Faith. That's 13 lessons planned." We started with the first and teaching it Kenzie. And she started memorizing it. Nate want her to have all 13 memorized by the time she is 8.		</p>

				Just about every day is miss match day here with my girls. Kenzie insists on wearing a skirt every day. And just last week Laney started to do the same. She's in that phase where she's doing everything Kenzie does. And since I let the girls pick out their own clothes they never really match. With Laney I can still get away with picking out her clothes except the skirt she wants to wear over her clothes. And as a mom, I've learned that I have to pick my battles and what they wear is not something I want to fight them on. The only time I make them wear something I pick out is when we're going somewhere nice and church.</p>

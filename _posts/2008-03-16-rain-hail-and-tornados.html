				We got hit with some crazy weather this weekend! Our city, got hit pretty hard with the storm passing right over us Friday night and majority of the day Saturday. Loud claps of thunder, heavy down pour, and golfball size hail showed no mercy on us. We turned on the news Saturday and the weathermen had a big day being it was the only thing on all local stations. Our county had tornado warnings throughout much of the day, but tornados actually formed after the heart of the storm had passed us.</p>
<p>Nate was the first to hear to tornado sirens go off as he was studying upstairs. It was his first time hearing tornado sirens. He wasn't quite sure what it was and came downstairs to ask me what it was. Luckily, our house did not suffer any damage from the storm. I did get some pictures of the large hail that hit us. Fortunately, we didn't lose power with this storm. The lights flickered throughout the day and nearby neighborhoods lost power for a bit. But we didn't have to endure another day without power as with the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/02/powerless/">last storm</a>.</p>

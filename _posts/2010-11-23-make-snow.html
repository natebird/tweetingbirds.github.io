				If you live in a place that doesn't have snow in the winter, you can always make snow like my kids. We were at Scott and Stacey's house one Sunday. Mia and Kenzie decided to shred ads from the newspaper and make snow. They had so much fun. Photos from my phone because I didn't have my camera with me. Isn't it nice to have cameras on phones now?</p>

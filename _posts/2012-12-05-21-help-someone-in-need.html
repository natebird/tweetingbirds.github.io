<p>This didn't turn out the way I had expected. When I wrote this task down on my list I was thinking along the lines of bringing someone a meal or helping someone move or watch someone's kids while they needed to go do something. It turned out that I ended up helping Irene after the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2012/11/till-we-meet-again/" target="_blank">sudden and unexpected passing of her husband Barron</a>. A sad and horrible situation but a friend was in need in an unexpected and unfortunate circumstance and without really thinking much about it, I dropped everything to help her with what I could.</p>
<p>I helped with funeral arrangements and the funeral service. Made phone calls to people, went with her to the cemetery to check it out before she purchased a plot, moral support, made the funeral program, printed photos for the service, got a P.O. box for people to send her cards, helped set up the website for people to make online donations, set up the Facebook page to keep people updated with what was happening, took her to the airport to pick up Tyler and Kelsey, emailed and sent letters to Cody to let him know things were working out for his mom, helped keep track of all the donations that were coming in, and helped out before the funeral with set up, during the funeral, and after the funeral at the family dinner. And even after the funeral, I have been checking up on her and keeping in touch with her to see how she is doing. Also my dad and I have been going over to her house to help with few other stuff here and there.</p>
<p>Barron and Irene are amazing people and I hate that something tragic like this happened to them. I can't imagine being in Irene's shoes. And a friend is a friend who is there before, during and after. Nate and I are also going to put together a book of memories from people who posted on the website for the family and Irene. I hope to have it done by Barron's birthday to give to the family.		</p>

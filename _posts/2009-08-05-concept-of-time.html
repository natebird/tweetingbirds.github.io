				Kenzie knows her birthday is coming up. And she is excited about it's arrival. Lately, we have been having this same conversation just about every day.
<div></div>
<div>Kenzie: My birthday is coming soon.</div>
<div>Tiffany: Yes it is. Do you know when it is?</div>
<div>Kenzie: August 9th. </div>
<div>Tiffany: That's right.</div>
<div>Kenzie: But it's not here yet. I have to wait 5 minutes, then it'll be my birthday.</div>

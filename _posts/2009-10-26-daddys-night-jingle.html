				Nate has a little jingle to advertise and excite the kids about Daddy's Night.</p>
<p>"It is Daddy's Night… And the feel is right…"</p>
<p>Every time I mention Daddy's Night, she sings the jingle and does the dance, just like her father. It's cute.</p>
<p>Then tonight, I told her during dinner that it was going to be bath night.</p>
<p>She sang, "It is bath night… And the water is right…"</p>
<p>Quite the lyricist.		</p>

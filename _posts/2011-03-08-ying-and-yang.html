<p>My girls may look alike. But they are not alike in personality. At all. And because of it, there are a lot of cat fights going on in our home. They do have moments where they play well together, usually when it's time for bed. But they also like to push each other's buttons too.</p>

<p>Ways they are different:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenzie is very orderly and things need to be a certain way. Even when she plays with toys. Laney has no order or cares for one. She does things her own way and there's no rhyme or reason for it. She is very creative with the ideas she comes up with.</li>
<li>Kenzie likes to boss Laney around and tell her what to do. Verbalization has always been Kenzie's strong point and Laney is getting much better at speaking. So she uses that to get things her way. And also because she's the big sister and that's what older siblings do. Laney doesn't care for what Kenzie has to say. She is good at following directions but not orders, especially from her sister. This frustrates Kenzie very much.</li>
<li>Laney likes to take toys away from Kenzie. And vice versa. Then someone cries. Laney does it sometimes just for the heck of it and runs away from Kenzie. She thinks it's funny. Or when Kenzie is preventing Laney from playing with something she wants, Laney will steal it when Kenzie glances away then throws it back at her.</li>
<li>Laney deals with frustration and anger by throwing or pushing things away. Kenzie deals with it by crying… a lot of crying.</li>
<li>Laney is very compassionate and sympathetic. She loves to take care of people and make sure they are OK. If Kenzie is crying, she will always go give her and hug and ask if she's OK. She also loves to take care of babies. Kenzie is very obedient. She will always do what is asked of her, no questions asked.</li>
<li>Kenzie tends to think Laney's life goal is to sabotage whatever she is doing. And since Laney doesn't speak as well, often times Kenzie will say, "Laney thinks…" or "Laney wants to do…", which has become a problem because (1) It doesn't encourage Laney to speak for herself. (2) Kenzie is usually wrong in thinking Laney wants to ruin or destroy whatever Kenzie is doing.</li>
<li>Laney is very independent and wants to grow up fast. She wants to do whatever Kenzie is doing and into whatever Kenzie likes. She is her own person and does things her own way, which is usually not the way Nate, Kenzie or I do things. But that doesn't mean it's the wrong way. Laney was the one who didn't want to wear bibs anymore, sit in high chairs or booster seats, wanted to use utensils when eating, and so forth. She has always been the one who decided, "I'm done with that. I'm moving on." I just hope the same will happen with potty training and weaning off the thumb sucking. Lately her big thing has been wanting to be in dance class with Kenzie. She'll put on her leotard and say, "Laney's class. Laney dance class. Let's go."</li>
<li>Kenzie looks for approval and praise of others. Laney doesn't care what other people thinks. So it's hard to convince Laney to do something unless she's whole heartedly into it herself.</li>
<li>Kenzie's favorite color is still pink. Laney's favorite color is yellow.</li>
<li>Together they eat one meal. Kenzie usually eats the stuff that Laney doesn't eat and vice versa.</li>
</ul>

<p>Ways they are alike:</p>
<ul>
<li>Both love girly things. They both like to dress up and be princesses.</li>
<li>Both likes to dance and sing.</li>
<li>They both try to do what's right.</li>
<li>They both like to read books and watch movies.</li>
<li>They are both very smart.</li>
</ul>

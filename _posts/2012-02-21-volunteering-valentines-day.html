<p>
				I was able to volunteer at Kenzie's school for Valentine's Day. They did Valentine's centers making cards, decorating cookies and decorating shoes boxes. Kenzie loves it when I come in to her class to volunteer. And I love being in there to help out. We ate lunch together and I also took a picture of her with her name on the wall by the cafeteria for being student of the month.</p>

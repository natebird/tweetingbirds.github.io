				As I was eating my lunch, Kenzie expressed the need to go to the bathroom. Since her step stool wasn't in there, I went to help her. When we walked into the bathroom, Kenzie proceeded to unroll the toilet paper and rip them in half. </p>
<p>Tiffany: Stop, Kenzie. Don't do that.<br />Kenzie: [with an apologetic face] Sorry, it's all my fault.<br />Tiffany: [chuckling a bit, giving Kenzie a kiss on her forhead] It's OK.<br />Kenzie: I don't want your kisses. <br />Tiffany: You don't want my kisses?!<br />Kenzie: You have food in your mouth, and it stinks.		</p>

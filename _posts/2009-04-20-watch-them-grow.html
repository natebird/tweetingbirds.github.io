<ul>
<li>Learning the sounds of the alphabet. She can tell you what letter just about any word starts with. </li>
<li>Finally managed to open doors. But we have no problems with her sneaking out of her room during nap or bed times.</li>
<li>Loves to do things all by herself. Won't allow mom or dad help her at all. This includes getting dressed, going to the potty (we finally got her some steps so she can get up by herself).</li>
<li>Loves to help out with Laney and snuggle with her. </li>
<li>Has a sassy and bossy attitude sometimes. </li>
<li>Have to have things in particular order or places (much like her mother).</li>
<li>Likes to play with kids older than her because they can communicate with her.</li>
<li>Still picky eater, but we can get her to eat her dinner by telling her she will grow bigger and taller like daddy.</li>
<li>Loves anything pink, princess, and ballerina. Mostly obsessed with Disney princesses. </li>
<li>Uses reason and logic to defend her case when we ask her to do something.</li>
<li>Can sing just about any Disney princess songs. Has seen all the princess movies and mostly memorized.</li>
</ul>
<p>Laney at 2 and half months:
<ul>
<li>Sleeping anywhere between 6-8 hours in the night. It's nice because I only need to get up once in the night to feed her.</li>
<li>Getting really chunky.</li>
<li>Loves to be talked to and she will coo and smile back.</li>
<li>Holds her head up by herself. </li>
<li>Starting to reach for thing, getting better hand coordination. </li>
<li>Moved into the guest room for now until we figure out what to do about a room for her.</li>
<li>Nurses every 4 hours during the day and only on one side.</li>
<li>Loves to kick her legs. </li>
<li>Growing out of 3 months clothes already.</li>
<li>Sleeps in the crib on her back. She's not sleeping in the car seat anymore now that her reflux is not an issue.</li>
<li>Is starting to teeth. Yes, already. She is taking after her sister who had a tooth cut through at 3 1/2 months.</li>
</ul>

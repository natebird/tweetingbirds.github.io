				Coming home from our Washington trip wasn't as pleasant as we had thought. Ever came home from a trip where you wished you stayed on vacation? This was one of those times. Everything went wrong. Maybe not<em>everything</em>. But just about everything.</p>
<p>We arrived home late Monday night, so we left all the unpacking and catching up for Tuesday. We had only that week to get things done around the house and get Nate all set and ready to start his new job the following Monday.</p>
<p>Tuesday wasn’t bad. Then everything started to fall apart on Wednesday. As I cooked dinner on Wednesday evening, we discovered fire ants in our kitchen floor. Huge red fire ants that bite. They were coming from our yard. They were all over our backyard. So the plan was for Nate to take the girls to Home Depot and purchase supplies needed to get rid of the fire ants inside and outside. I had to be at church Wednesday night for YW. I was going to take his car since the car seats were in my car.</p>
<p>As we were heading out the door, Nate found his car had a completely depleted tire. He had two tires that needed to be replaced because they were pretty worn. But the depleted tire was not one of the worn tires. It was one of the newer ones, of course. That put us down to one car and I had to miss mutual. Instead, we took a family trip to Home Depot and bought ant killers for the lawn. As soon as we returned home, Nate spread it throughout the yard. Bye bye ants.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the end of it. Friday Nate took his car in to purchase two new tires and have the hole patched in the depleted tire. It turned out that the hole couldn’t be patched. So $240 and <em>five hours</em> later, we have all new tires on his car. Five hours? Yes, people. The mechanic told Nate it would take an hour. Well, he was wrong.</p>
<p>And Friday morning, I woke up with my body itching. I didn’t think much of it until I saw small red marks here and there. Then I freaked. Could it be bed bugs or fleas? We don’t have any pets and had no idea how either one of those pests could get in the house. So I washed everything on our bed in scalding hot water. Then dried in the dryer with the heat turned on high.</p>
<p>But then around 11 p.m. the red marks turned into hives. I started to break out in hives all over my body. After some backtracking and detective work, we came to the conclusion that it was the fabric softener that we used to wash our clothes in Washington. I never use fabric softener with our laundry at home. But Nate’s mom had some at her house and it smelled fantastic. So I used it. Now I know. I’m allergic to it. Downey's almond bliss fabric softeners. Probably other fabric softeners too. I went through all our clean clothes to pick out the ones washed with fabric softener to rewash them. Twice. Fun.</p>
<p>Saturday Nate took my car in for routine oil change and tires balance. The mechanic told him it would take half an hour. Three hours later, he came back with news from the mechanic that we need to have our transmission fluids flushed and there is a crack in the crankshaft and it's leaking oil. We thought we would take it for a second opinion elsewhere.</p>
<p>Other than dealing with all this, we also went shopping for some work clothes for Nate. He has to dress up in shirt and tie twice a week and business casual the other 3 days. So we loaded him up with some new shirts and pants. Got a great deal at Kohl's.</p>
<p>Friday night before the hives attacked my body, we went to the stake center for Sam being set apart as a missionary. I can't believe little Sam is on his mission! To Seattle, Washington! He'll love it and be an awesome missionary. At the stake center, we were able to meet Elder Richard Hinkley and shake his hand. He's a little taller than I had expected. Very nice and kind like his father. Sam was President Gary Futual's last missionary. We love President Futual. He has been a close friend of our family forever.</p>
<p>I also had stake meetings Saturday morning. Thanks to Benadryl, I was able to get rid of the hive and be at my meeting, a little drowsy still. Sunday we had stake conference where we got a new stake presidency… President Watson Nichols, Bro. Jared Marcom and Bro. Ivan Lybbert. I'm excited about them. They will be wonderful.		</p>

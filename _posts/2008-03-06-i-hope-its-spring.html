				Today we had a beautiful sunny day where Kenzie and I were able to go outside and play. We kicked her ball around the backyard, cooked some leaves, and soak in the sunshine. I hope the weather stays like this, but I think we are getting a cold front coming in this weekend with maybe a chance of flurries. Darn.</p>
<p>Lately, Kenzie likes to ride on our leg and have us bounce her up and down as shown in the bottom picture. And she has learned about 20 more words this past week. She is picking up on words really quickly, learning at least 3-4 new words each day. Her latest word is button, but she doesn't say the "on" part and just says "butt". It took a minute for me to understand what she was saying because we didn't teach her to say "butt" in terms of a rear end, we taught her to say "bum" for that. Then I saw her say "butt" while pushing buttons and realized that's what she meant.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R9BAnAcNdwI/AAAAAAAABkE/6m1Dh0BOXyY/s1600-h/IMG_7627.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7627.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5174707010726098690" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R9BAngcNdxI/AAAAAAAABkM/SzgdvqqD0pg/s1600-h/IMG_7629.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7629.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5174707019316033298" /></a>		</p>

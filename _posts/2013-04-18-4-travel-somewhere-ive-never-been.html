				So I went to a new store with Emily to shop for fabric. We had been talking about doing that for a long time and finally did. It was fabric heaven for us. We loved it. Then we went out to lunch at Ikea and walked around Ikea. The whole time without kiddos. It was awesome. </p>

<p>But Nate and I also planned a trip to Tampa, Florida, in June. That was the only time we can work it with our schedules and school. I've never been to Tampa before so that should be super fun. This will also be a trip without the kids. I am looking forward to that. 		</p>

				Nate came home from work and noticed laminated fish inside a blue painted shoe box on the couch. Standing over the couch, Nate asked Kenzie, "Kenzie, what's this?" Kenzie glance over at her father, noting him staring at it, she responded, "A couch."</p>
<p>A few minutes later, Kenzie got her step stool from the kitchen and brought it into the living room setting it next to the LoveSac. Nate, once again, wondering what his little girl may be up to with her step stool asked, "What's that for?" Kenzie, without even looking at her father this time, responded, "For stepping."		</p>

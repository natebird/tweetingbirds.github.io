				Kind of sad when I'm posting a proud moment that I had while shopping and it had nothing to do with my child. Oh well, I love it when I strike a good deal. Kenzie is in desperate need of pink winter clothes. I pulled out some pants and shirts from last winter, but they are getting much too short.</p>
<p>I went shopping with my mom today and I scored:
<ul>
<li>4 pairs of toddler pants</li>
<li>2 toddler shirts</li>
<li>1 toddler sweater</li>
<li>4 toddler skirts</li>
<li>1 pair of white toddler church shoes</li>
<li>1 set of 12 tall drinking glasses</li>
<li>2 preschool games (Hi-Ho Cherry-O and Jr. Boggle)</li>
<li>1 floor puzzle</li>
<li>1 white board and black board combo easel. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Total: $28.78</span></span></p>
<p>Then I stopped at Target to pick up some fresh broccoli and cauliflower for $0.33 a head.

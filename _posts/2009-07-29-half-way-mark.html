<p>My lovely husband just completed his first year of the MBA program. It was a tough year as I was pregnant and called as the YW president his first semester. He then lost his job at the end of first semester. And then Laney came at the beginning of his second semester. This past semester (third semester) was jam packed with four long classes. He was in class Monday through Thursday from 6 to 9:30 p.m. with a 45-minute commute there and 35-minute commute home. However, many nights he would have group meetings before and/or after class.</p>
<p>It funny the perspective we have with Nate attending a school outside of Utah. Nate's classmates here are shocked that he is under 30 years old, married with a wife and two kids. That is because he is probably the only one in that situation. Of his class, maybe 60-70 percent of them are engaged/married. Most of them are 30 or older. Out of those who are married, maybe 30 percent of them have one baby at home. This is why he is trying to finish in two years rather than three and half like the rest of his classmates.</p>
<p>I am so proud of Nate for getting into such a great MBA program at a prestigious school. And getting good grades in all his classes. He enjoys the school and learning more about business. Being the only top 25 MBA school who had 100% employment placement for their graduates last year, we're hoping Nate will be able to find a good job this next year. He will start the career placement program for the school in the fall. Wish us luck!

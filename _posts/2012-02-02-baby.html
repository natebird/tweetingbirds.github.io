				Kenzie's dance class is doing the Justin Beiber "Baby" song for her hip-hop recital. All the girls in her class love that song and sing along when they are dancing. Nate has verbally expressed his disapproval for that song since he is not a fan of Justin Beiber in anyway. Kenzie comes home singing, "Baby, baby, babyâ€¦" So of course Laney will sing it too. So we have two girls going around the house singing it. Laney was singing it one time and Kenzie said, "Don't sing that song! That song is for teenagers with no taste." It was a proud moment for Nate.		</p>

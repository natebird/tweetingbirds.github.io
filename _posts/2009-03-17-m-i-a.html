				I'll post a ton of pictures once I survive this week. It's Nate's spring break… although, as he said, it's not much of a break since he is loaded with homework and a case study. I am taking advantage of the fact that he is home in the evenings everyday this week.</p>
<p>This is what I have going this week, also what you have to look forward to (photos included) when I catch up on my posts:</p>
<p>Monday: We had FHE with Nate! A rare occasion. YW question jar. And Kenzie's homework.<br />Tuesday: Kenzie's new pink pet. Library story time. Friends over.<br />Wednesday: Making of more cream puffs for New Beginnings. Sister missionaries over for dinner.<br />Thursday: Writing my talk for New Beginnings. And New Beginnings - the making of my cute purses.<br />Friday: Play date. My stepbrothers over for dinner and Wii time.<br />Saturday: An attempt to visit a state park. Stake R.S. birthday celebration dinner.<br />Sunday: A day of meetings for me. And hopefully a day of rest.</p>
<p>*** Tender & Guilty Mommy Moment***</p>
<p>Yesterday, while I was upstairs getting some YW stuff done on the computer, Kenzie was downstairs playing. She came to the stairs and said, "Mommy, I very miss you."</p>
<p>Awww… I thought how sweet that she missed me while I'm just upstairs. Then I felt a bit guilty that I haven't spent much time with her because I was trying to get things done for church and around the house. "I miss you, too, Kenzie," I said.</p>
<p>"I miss you when you're at church at your meetings," Kenzie said to clarify. Oh, now I really felt guilty. She already knows that Daddy is gone all the time with school and Mommy is gone all the time with church meetings.</p>
<p>I don't know how other moms do it. Balance everything they need to do without feeling guilty that they are neglecting their children. I'm sure all moms feel guilty at some point. Maybe the question should be, how do moms balance everything and still make time for their kids and husband?		</p>

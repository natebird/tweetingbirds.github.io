Rather than obeying, she picked up her shorts and panties than threw it in my face. Uh oh. I scolded her for throwing things at mom and being disrespectful. Then I took her upstairs to her room, put on her pajama, and put her in bed. It was bedtime and it was a long day with no naps. But as a consequence of her disrespectfulness, I told her she didn't get bedtime stories that night. </p>
<p>As expected, she broke out in a loud cry that quickly turned into hyperventilating. After letting her cry about it for a while, I went into her room and lectured her about how we do not throw things at people. She was sad and regretted not listening to mom. However, Kenz is the type of girl that beats herself up about her wrong doings. So I spent the next half hour convincing her that yes, she was in trouble, but next time she will know how to better behave. She kept crying, wanting to go downstairs to reenact the whole situation but this time she was going to listen to mom. </p>
<p>Seeing the camera in the kitchen, she asked me to take a picture of her. Nate asked her if she wanted mom to blog about her getting in trouble, she responded, <span style="font-style:italic;">No</span>. Oh well.		</p>

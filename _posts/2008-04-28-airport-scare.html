				Our Utah saga began with my exciting race across the airport also known as the worldâ€™s busiest passenger airport. The morning of April 21, Kenzie and I were set to catch the 9:05 a.m. Frontier Airlines flight from here to Salt Lake City with a 30 minute layover in Denver, Colorado. This was the first time I traveled alone with Kenzie. We were set and left the house at 6:35 a.m. knowing the airport was extremely busy on Monday mornings with all the business travelers.</p>
<p>My troubles actually began on the way to the airport as we were stuck on I-575 with bumper-to-bumper traffic. Once we got on I-75, we were pretty much at a complete halt. We sat there watching the minutes ticked by and listening to Kenzie getting impatient with the supposedly 40 minute ride to the airport. My heart started racing as I am not the kind of person who likes to be late to events, especially to appointments set with an airline company. I must admit, my frustrations came out on Nate who was doing his best to get us to the airport as fast as he legally could. I later learned that two different accidents, one involving a semi, caused the freeway to be completely shut down that morning.</p>
<p>Time passed faster than the car was driving, and we eventually made it to the airport at 8:35 a.m. It took us two hours to get from our front door to the drop off at the airport. I just knew I missed my flight because I was running to the desks of Frontier Airlines to check in as the passengers board the plane of my same flight.</p>
<p>As soon as I got out of the car, I had Kenzie in the big travel system strollers with her car seat sitting on the bottom basket of the stroller. I had her little pink backpack in the bottom basket of the stroller. I was also carrying my own backpack and two suitcases with my left hand and pushing the stroller/car seat combo with my right. I didn't even have time to give Nate a kiss goodbye.</p>
<p>I rapidly raced to the Frontier desk and handed the lady my ID and printed flight information. As she was punching in my information on her computer, her co-worker next to her asked, "Are you checking her in? She is not going to make the flight." I was in a frantic state and at the edge of emotional breakdown, just beg for mercy at the desk. I could not miss this flight, with it being a busy Monday and with only a 30 minute layover for my second flight, I could be stuck at the airport all day with an infant and absolutely nothing to do. The co-worker then said, "If you are checking her in, you better take her in because she is going to miss the flight."</p>
<p>As the Frontier employee who was helping me took my two suitcases that I checked in, she printed my tickets and handed it to me while we were speeding toward the security check-in. She explained the gate number and the importance of running at full speed all the way to the gate. She then said, "I could get in a lot of trouble for this if my boss finds out." I thank her graciously for her help. She took me to the front of the security line where a security guard was watching people and keeping order. I noticed the lines of people I was walking pass waiting for their turn in security. The all lines weaved through the pole barriers, went past the restaurants and all the way back to the gift shops.</p>
<p>This lady told the security guard that I am late for my flight because of her and wanted him to check me in at the beginning of the line. He looked around for her employee badge, and that's when she noticed she had left it at the desk. With not enough time to run back to get it, she begged to let me in through security. She points to the sleeve of her uniform where it said Frontier, hoping that would convince him. He was skeptical, but let me in anyway. From there, I was guided to keep going to the front of the families and special needs line.  I still had to stand in line waiting for the four people ahead of me go through security.</p>
<p>Once I got close to the conveyer belt, I unloaded my backpack and took out the quart size ziplock bag with my liquids, unloaded Kenzie's backpack with her liquids, and took off my shoes (I wore clogs for convenience) and jacket. But the lady security guard told me I needed to fold up the stroller and unhook the car seat to put through the x-rays. So I went back to the conveyer belt, got Kenzie out and did as I was told. However, the lady behind me (a foreigner) was trying to push her stuff through before mine for some unknown reason. She still had to wait for me to get through the scanner first because the rest of my stuff had already came out on the other side of the x-rays. The whole time we were crisscrossing since half my stuff ended up before hers and the other half after hers.</p>
<p>When I finally collected all my stuff and put together the stroller to put Kenzie in it and the car seat sitting behind, I ran to the elevator that took me down to the subway to get to my designated concourse. I crammed myself and the big stroller into the elevator with two other wheelchair travelers and their assistants. I was never fond of the elevator smell, especially packed full of travelers because no one smells good when they travel, everything just smells like sweat. As I got out of the elevator, I ran toward the subway where I saw a sign noting the distance of Concourse D, where my plane is getting ready to take off. I thought maybe I could run to Concourse D faster than the subway could go since it had to make stops along the way. That thought quickly diminished as I saw the sign said, "Concourse D - 5,000 ft."</p>
<p>I hopped on the subway squeezing in with several thousand travelers. As more passengers got on the subway, I got pushed farther back into the subway with the stroller. When the subway reached Concourse D, I was so far back, I couldn't turn the stroller around. And the lady in front of me wouldn't move aside. I yell, "Excuse me!" several times, but still no movement from my blocker. So I had to eventually push her out of the way with the stroller and got the stroller half way out of the door for the door to reopen and announce, "Please step away from the door. Someone is blocking the door." I said sorry to my blocker and continued my mad-dash to the elevator to take me back up to the concourse.</p>
<p>This time I was stuck in a smaller elevator with only one wheelchair traveler and his assistant. However, we had to make a pit stop at a midlevel as a janitor wanted to get on the full elevator with a huge rolling trash can. Noticing the compactness, he waved us on. As I got out of the elevator, I quickly saw I got out around gate 27 when my gate is all the way at the end of the concourse at gate 7. So I ran. I'm sure people were looking at me as some mad woman pushing a stroller with one hand while holding the car seat under the stroller handle bars with the other, weaving in and out of people going both directions. Kenzie was good through all this because I think she was unsure of what was happening.</p>
<p>After my run through the crowd with a big stroller, I reached my gate sweating and panting. The Frontier employees at the gate asked if I was Tiffany because they were waiting for me. They checked in the stroller and car seat at the gate. I was the last one to get on the plane. They closed the door behind me and got ready for take off as I sat down. And I prayed that my luggage made it to the plane faster than me. The upside of all this was the traffic on the freeway caused about 10 other passengers to miss the flight. Therefore, I was able to get a seat with an empty seat next to me for Kenzie.</p>
<p>Kenzie was actually pretty good on the flight the whole time. I kept her entertained with coloring books, snacks, drinks, and a little bit of Barney on a portable DVD player. When we got to the Denver airport for my connection flight, my gate was supposed to be just right across from the one I arrived in. With my luck that morning, of course that was not how it turned out. My connection gate had been moved to the other side of the airport, except this time I didn't hav<br />
e a stroller to put Kenzie in because it had been checked into Salt Lake City. I had Kenzie in one arm, a backpack on my back, and another backpack on the other arm, making my way across the Denver airport. I got there just in time as they were announcing the final call for boarding.</p>
<p>I'm just glad I made it and my luggage made it.		</p>

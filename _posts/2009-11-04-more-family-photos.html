				Call me picky, but I wasn't satisfied with the family pictures we took at the botanical gardens. This time, we used a tripod and took some pictures while I was sick with flu-like symptoms. I downed a few Tylenols to endure this quick photo shoot. The kids weren't into having family photos.</p>
<p>I'm still not 100 percent satisfied with these. There's something funky with my camera and the pictures are coming out funny. It's been happening since Nate took the camera to his sister's wedding. Humâ€¦ maybe it was when Nate had the camera in the camera case but in his carry on luggage. The overhead compartments were full and they checked Nate's luggage in and tossed it below. AAAAHHHHH!!!! I'd about died when he told me this. Save my camera! Take it out. I don't care if they are holding up the plane waiting for you to get it out of your luggage. AAAAHHH!!! My camera is never leaving my side ever again.</p>
<p>I hope to figure out what it is so I can go back to good looking pictures again.</p>

				Laney was my rough childâ€¦ until Lai Lai came along. At around 1 year, she had bruises all over her body from climbing on things and hitting things or running into thing. At her one year checkup, the doctor said he couldn't help me much with that because he didn't have a cure for "daredevil." I especially liked the one on her cheek that looked like a side mustache.</p>

<p>And this one with the knot on her forehead on the right side of the picture. She ran into the piano on this one.</p>

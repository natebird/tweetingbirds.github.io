				I took Kenzie out of school one day to go on a dance field trip to the Fox Theater to watch the Atlanta Ballet Company dance the Nutcracker. It was a shorter one hour version for school field trips. It was perfect. They did an act then showed the kids a little about backstage then finished up with another act. I took Laney and Kenzie, had my mom watch Lai Lai. The older girls loved it. The costumes were gorgeous, the dances were amazing, my girls knew the music because we had been listening to it at home, and the Fox Theater was so cool. It was all of our first time there at the Fox. So much history there. </p>
<p>Afterwards we stopped by Nate's office to drop off a gift for his boss that Nate had forgotten at home. It was our first time visiting Nate's work. Said hi to his boss. The girls checked out the view from his office and drew Nate a picture on his gigantic white board. It was nice for the girls to see dad since he had been working 14-15 hour days, leaving before they are awake and getting home after they are asleep. </p>

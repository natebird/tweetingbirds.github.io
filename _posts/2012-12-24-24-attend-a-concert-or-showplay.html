<p>This year for Christmas we didn't want to get the girls a lot of presents, especially toys. They don't need any more things. And frankly, I am tired of picking up all their things and seeing them everywhere. So we decided to down size on the presents and do more family things. One of the things we did was I took the two older girls to watch The Nutcracker a couple Saturdays ago. This was their first time seeing the ballet. We have the Barbie version of the movie at home. So that gave them an introduction to the characters and some of the music and the plot. It was a local dance company's ballet production. One of our friends had a daughter who had a few parts in the performance.</p>
<p>Both girls loved it. Laney, especially, was so into it. She loved the costumes and watching the girls dance on point. I am so glad. I want to make this a tradition.</p>

<p>
				Welcome to a new year! 2014, I have a feeling, is going to be lots of happy and sad moments. There will be a lot of changes for our family this year. We will have a new addition to the family in 7 weeks (or less). Nate will most likely start a new job. We would like to move to a bigger house. We will lose Nate's dad. And who knows what will happen with my mom and her cancer. One of Nate's siblings already got married on Jan. 3. The last single sibling will probably get married some time this summer. Kenzie will turn 8 and get baptized. Lai Lai will start dance in the fall and Laney will start kindergarten too. I will hopefully work hard to get my body back in shape postpartum. And I hope there is a beach vacation somewhere in there for us. We are in dire need of a vacation.</p>
<p>So my word for the year is memories. With all that is going on in our families - Nate's dad coming to an end with his battle with cancer, and my mom fighting cancer for the second time - our priorities and perspective on life has changed. It's no longer about what we have, how much money we can make, or even what accomplishments we have. It's all about what we do with our time. I want to take more pictures this year. I want to create and preserve many good and bad memories. I want to focus more on family time and lessen distractions.</p>
<p>Here's to another great year!		</p>

<p>The weekend when I was at Irene's house helping out with funeral stuff, Nate called me saying I needed to come home because Lai Lai fell off the school desk and hit her eye. It was bleeding and he couldn't stop it. Later he calls back and said he got it to stop bleeding but it was at a part of her eye where he couldn't keep a butterfly bandage on it. It turned out fine. She was just more scared than anything.		</p>

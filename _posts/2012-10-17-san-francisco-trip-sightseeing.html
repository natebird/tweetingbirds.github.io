				Nicole and Alex's wedding was Saturday but the festivities and stuff started on Friday. Since we arrived the in wee hours of Wednesday morning, we had all day Wednesday and Thursday to sightsee in SF before heading to Fremont for wedding stuff. If we are going to take our kids across the country, we mind as well make a trip out of it. Prior to the trip, we made a list of a few places we would like to see in SF. The last time I was there I was 6, so I don't remember much about the place. And it had been a long time since the last time Nate was there too. We had our rental van and we were ready to go.</p>
<p>Our hotel was at Fisherman's Warf so it was nicely located to all the places we wanted to see and do.Â Nate and I splurged and ate at a really nice fresh seafood at Pier 39. And we ate at a bunch of other really yummy restaurants and places. It was definitely a food vacation. So yummy! SF weather was gorgeous until the day we got there. Then it was cloudy, foggy and rainy. We brought umbrellas and we were so glad we had our own vehicle. We paid quite a bit for parking, but it was worth not having to lug all the kids everywhere and get to places faster. Since it was rainy, cold and wet, we didn't walk the Golden Gate Bridge. We just paid to toll to drive across it. We also went to Crissy Field, the Exploratorium, the zigzag part of Lombard Street, Ghirardelli Square, went on part of the driving tour, drove across Bay Bridge as we headed out, went to the Ferry Building, and a few other stuff.</p>

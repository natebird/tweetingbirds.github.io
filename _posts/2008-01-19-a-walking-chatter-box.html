				I am amazed and often humored by Kenzie's ability to communicate using actual English language. Yesterday when Kenzie and I spent the day with my parents (going to my dad's school and to Costco), she had a nice chat with her Dudepa and Puo Puo telling them everything that was on her mind. Her part of the conversation consisted of school, baby, go!, meow, no, ruff, ball, mom, and daddy.</p>
<p>Toward the end of the day Kenzie called Nate on the phone to tell him about her day (we were still at my parents' house). The conversation went something like this...</p>
<p>Nate: Hi, Kenzie! Are you having fun?<br />Kenzie: No!<br />Tiffany: Kenzie, can you tell daddy you went to school today?<br />Kenzie: School!<br />Nate: Wow! Did you go to school to see Dudepa?<br />Kenzie: School!<br />Tiffany: Kenzie, can you tell daddy we also went shopping at Costco?<br />Kenzie: Costco!<br />(Laughter from all the adults involved in the conversation.)<br />Tiffany: Now that's Nate's side of the family, learning to say Costco as one of her first few words.</p>
<p>Other words Kenzie can say since my last post about her talking (Jan. 3).

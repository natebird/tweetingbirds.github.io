				She is so excited for kindergarten! I took her by herself to register for kindergarten and she was nervous because they did a little testing to place them with certain teachers. She did great. I legacy her into Mrs. DeLuca's class, that was Kenzie's teacher. She should do well in that class with her. I can't believe she is going to kindergarten already. She is so ready for it though. </p>

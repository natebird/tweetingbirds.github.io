				When Nate and I bought this house, we were so excited to own a home. After living in a one bedroom apartment at BYU together and then a two bedroom apartment in Canton before bought the house. We thought it was huge. We had so much room. Then slowly, we started to fill it up with kids, stuff and furniture. We still love the house and especially love the location of it. It's right off the freeway, which cuts commute time for Nate who travels to midtown each day for work. It's close to grocery stores and 10 minutes away from more shopping. It's close to church, it's close to school, it's in a good school district. </p>
<p>The biggest thing is we are running out of space in our current house. It would be nice to have a bigger yard and a basement. I am desperate to have a studio room for all my craft things and my machines to be out. We have no idea where we would move to because we are not sure we want to stay in Canton. We are not sure we want to stay in Georgia. Our dream would be to move out of the country for a couple of years some day for the experience. </p>
<p>We recently refinanced our mortgage so we can pay off more toward equity and hopefully sell this house in the next few years. Then realistically we will probably rent a house somewhere until we figure out where we want to go. Buying a house seem to permanent right now, especially with how the economy and the housing market dropped. We just don't know where we want to be long term. So we'll see where life takes us. 		</p>

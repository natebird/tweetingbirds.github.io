<p>I love to read books. I used to read lots of books. Then I ran out of time to read books. Too busy doing other things. And when I do have a moment to read, it's usually late at night when I am so tired that I am dead asleep after reading one paragraph. So I made it a goal to read a book before I turned 30. I started with a book that Nate's mom recommended called "Raising Children Unto the Lord." I am still working on that. But then Kenzie got a bunch of Ready Freddy books for Christmas. She loved them. I wanted to read at least one of them so I know what they are like and some of the characters. I read one of those books in one sitting. Then I ordered the book, "Helping the Thumb-Sucking Child" to help me wean Laney from her thumb-sucking habit. I read that in a day and half. I'm glad that was an easy read. It was an interesting book with some helpful tips and ideas. Although I didn't agree with everything the book said. I got what I wanted out of it and hope Laney can kick the habit soon. I still hope to finish reading "Raising Children Unto the Lord" before my birthday.		</p>

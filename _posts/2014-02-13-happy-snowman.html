				We had another three days of snow day. Tuesday snow came down in the morning but was all washed away by the afternoon when rain and warmer temperature came. Wednesday icy snow came down and everything was ice over by an inch. We lost the power twice but luckily it was only for about half an hour each time. Everything stayed icy all day and night. Then Thursday morning we woke up to 2-3 inches of snow outside over everything. It was beautiful. By noon things started to melt with the sun out and temperature warming to just above freezing. But the girls and Nate went out to play in the snow for a bit before it was gone. They had enough snow to build a snowman. They had a great time. And luckily the older two girls' rain boots came on Tuesday, just in time for them to use in this wet weather. Unfortunately my rain boots didn't come in time. It was supposed to get here Thursday and due to weather it didn't get here till after all the wet snow. </p>
<p>I was also very fortunate that the baby didn't come when we were iced in Wednesday. And Tuesday I was able to make it to my OB appointment. I was still the same, dilated to 2 cm. This baby doesn't want to come out. I am usually dilated to 4 cm by now. So I will probably make it to my next OB appointment on Monday and they will then schedule an induction date. Hopefully earlier in the week than later. Nate is still trying to get work stuff done before the baby gets here so he's glad this baby is staying in. I'm ready for it to come out.   </p>

				We had a simple Christmas Eve this year. We went over to my parents' house as usual and had dinner. Then we exchanged gifts with them. My parents got Kenzie and Laney limited edition Barbie dolls that they love. Laney has been asking for Barbie stuff especially for her birthday. And then they got Lai Lai a play center. It was huge and she had the best reaction to the gift when she unwrapped it. She was so excited that it was her very own present and she hugged it and made sure dad put it in the van very carefully to take it home. And it was fun that Jeffrey was there too. He got the girls Monsters University which they love too. I got my mom a 16x20" canvas of my parents, me and Jeffrey. A family picture we had done. And I had a custom bow tie made for my dad of a Aloha print that I ordered from Hawaii.</p>

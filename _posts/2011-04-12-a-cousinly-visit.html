				Nate's sister and her family came to visit us. This was our girls' first time meeting a cousin on Nate's side of the family. Of course we had to wait 4 years before any cousin finally came around. But we were all excited to meet little William Bear. He's quite adorable and a well mannered baby. We also had a great visit with Natalie and John. They were here Saturday evening and left on Thursday morning.</p>
<p>Nate had to work most of their visit but we did take time to go out to lunch with him one day. We took them to the famous Varsity in downtown. Plus it's in the neighborhood of Nate's school.</p>

<p>Laney stuck a bunch of straws in her drink and insisted on drinking using 3 straws. Oh the talent.</p>

<p>I love the frosted orange and their peach pies. Oh yum!</p>

<p>And while they were here, we had to get in some cousin bath time. Just so we can embarrass them later in life.</p>

<p>Unfortunately their entire visit were rained out with thunder storms. They got to enjoy some Southern storms but we weren't able to do much outside. The one day where we had cloudy and no rain we went to Stone Mountain. Since it was off season, only the Sky Ride and museums were open. But that worked out just fine for us and the children.</p>

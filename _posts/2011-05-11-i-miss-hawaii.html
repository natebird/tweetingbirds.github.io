				Ever since I did May Day week on Simply Modern Mom, I've been listening to Hawaiian Reggae music online whenever I've been working on the computer. I miss Hawaii. It was the best place to grow up. I hope to go back there someday with Nate and the kids so they can see where I grew up and get a glimpse of the awesomeness of Hawaii. I made these "Island Girl" and "Aloha" shirts for the girls to wear to the beach this summer. And I made some more yarn leis since I have no access to tropical flowers and plants here.</p>

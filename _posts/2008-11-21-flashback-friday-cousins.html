<p>
				When we lived in Hawaii, we didn't have any family around. So I didn't know what it was like to have such a wonderful and an abundance of grandparents, aunties, uncles, and cousins around. I really enjoy living close to my family. We have many family gatherings each month - holidays, monthly FHE, and other events.</p>
<p>During my high school years, I was blessed to have wonderful cousins who are my age or a little older. Philip, Patrick, Joycelyn, Richard and I were all best of friends going to all the church youth activities together and hanging out at family functions. Now we are all grown up, mostly married, having kids, some going to school, some working, and all living busy lives. But we all still live relatively close to each other and hang out with each other at family functions.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSbhYSevKcI/AAAAAAAACwQ/lleTq6k36pc/s1600-h/IMG_0198.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 211px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0198.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271148221277612482" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSbhYImVpHI/AAAAAAAACwI/hN-XQD_DIkU/s1600-h/IMG_0193.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 204px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0193.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271148218625139826" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSbhYILpl7I/AAAAAAAACwA/ba6WXbciIhw/s1600-h/IMG_0153.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 216px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0153.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5271148218513201074" /></a>		</p>

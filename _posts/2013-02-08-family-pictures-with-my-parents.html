				Last Christmas, as in 2011, my brother Jeffrey and I went in on a gift for my parents. We got them a photo shoot to take family pictures. The last time we had family pictures done I was a freshman in high school. Yeah, a long time ago. It needed an update. We bought a package deal from Groupon. We did it right before Christmas because we were leaving on a trip after Christmas. And we wanted it done by Christmas for my parents' gifts. The photographer was really nice. It was a girl that lived in Marietta. But then she said she sent the CD with the photos to me but I didn't receive it. So I emailed her and she sent it again. Didn't get it until way later. The pictures turned out decent. She had a Nikon and it looked like a 50mm lens on it. She took a lot of shots, but what she sent me, some of it I wasn't really impressed. And she asked us to pose in weird places where the backgrounds didn't turn out every well. The ones that turned out best were places I chose. Oh well, next time I will go with a photographer recommended with my similar taste rather than just someone random. </p>
<p>And that day was freezing cold outside. Laney ended up later that evening getting a cold/croup. And she passed that around the other kids while we were on vacation after Christmas in Gatlinburg. </p>

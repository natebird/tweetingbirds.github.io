				Prefaces: Kenzie is not a fan of loud machine noises such as vacuums, blender, so forth. About a month ago, we were walking in a parking lot to the car and one of the cars started as Kenzie walked pass the front of it. It frightened her and it was a traumatizing experience. Since then, she hasn't wanted to walk in parking lots or in driveways with cars, even if it's parked and no one in them. I have been trying to work with Kenzie over this fear of walking in parking lots. I can't hold her while carrying a 16+ pound baby in a car seat through parking lots when we go out.</p>
<p>This past Sunday, Nate commended Kenzie for being brave walking to the car on our way home from a friend's house.</p>
<p>Nate to Tiffany: Kenzie was being very brave and walked to the car while holding Daddy's hand.<br />Tiffany to Kenzie: Wow, Kenzie. You did such a good job.<br />Kenzie: I was brave like princess Jasmine. I was only freaking a little bit.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">On Monday, Nate was vacuuming upstairs while Kenzie, Laney, and I were sitting on the couch downstairs - away from the scary vacuum.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Tiffany: Laney, what is that noise?</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Kenzie: That's the vacuum. I'm scared of the vacuum.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Tiffany: Why are you scared of the vacuum? I thought you were brave.</div>
<div style="text-align: left;">Kenzie: I am brave. I'm just freaking a little bit.</div>

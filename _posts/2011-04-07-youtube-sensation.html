				Not really. But I'm on YouTube now. <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/02/my-first-video-job/">My Samsung job I did in Raleigh</a> is now made public. I don't think I'll ever get used to seeing me on video. And if you know me, you can tell I sound nasal-y because I was at the tail end of a head cold. And can you see a little pregnant belly there? </p>
<p>This past weekend I was at Best Buy to exchange something and I happened to browse by the TV department. I saw some Samsung Smart TV on display there and they were showing their AllShare feature (the one I did the tutorial for) and I was really hoping they wouldn't start showing this video. Uh, that would be way too embarrassing! </p>

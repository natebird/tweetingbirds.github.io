<p>Kenzie had a wonderful time at her party. In fact, during her party she exclaimed, "Now this is how we celebrate!" It was very cute. She was so excited to have all her close friends there. We tried to keep the party small and only invited six families. It still turned out to be quite a bit of people with their siblings and parents, which was expected. We all had a great time getting together and celebrating Kenzie.</p>

<p>We missed pictures a couple of the kids. But here were most of them. Laney had a great time too. She loves having people over and kids to play with. She just went along with everything.</p>

<p>We started with a little craft. They made animal puppets on popsicle sticks. And played in the playroom with toys. Jumped off the LoveSac.</p>

<p>Then we ate food as soon as it arrived. We just got Little Ceaser's pizzas and I made a veggie plate, fruit salad and chips and dips.</p>

<p>After lunch, all the kids went outside to hit the piñata. All the kids had a turn hitting the piñata and only put a couple dents in it. After the kids, we had one of the parents whack it open. The kids went nuts. I filled it with tons of candy, so everyone was able to fill their goody bags.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1982" title="IMG_4889 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4889.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1983" title="IMG_4933 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4933.jpg" alt="" width="441" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1984" title="IMG_4947 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4947.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Once they were filled with candy, we came back inside to open gifts. While Kenzie opened gifts, I set up the ice cream bar and got the cake ready to go. We sang Happy Birthday then let the kids go at the ice cream bar and fill up on sugar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1985" title="IMG_4954 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4954.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1988" title="IMG_4975 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4975.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1987" title="IMG_4971 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4971.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>It was hard holding the kids back while singing Happy Birthday. But they did good. And once the song was over, they went for it.</p>

<p>Gummi bears and M&amp;Ms were favorite toppings. I don't even think gummi bears made it to the ice cream bowls. I think it went straight to their mouths. It was so fun to watch the kids devour all that sugar.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1992" title="IMG_5005 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5005.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>The after party…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1994" title="IMG_5022 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5022.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>It was a simple and lovely party. Kenzie loved it. All the kids seemed to have fun. And it was nice to see all our friends.		</p>

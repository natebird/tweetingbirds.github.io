<p>I grew up a beach person. Nate grew up a lake person. It mostly had to do with where we grew up. Hawaii and Washington. But surely and slowly I'm turning Nate into a beach person.</p>

<p>We had the best time on our beach vacation with my family. There were 25 of us all together. We rented two beach houses - one on the beach and one directly across the street with easy public access to the beach. We were in the house across the street with my parents and Scott and Stacey and their kids (Mia, Beau and his wife Candace). It worked out so well especially since our kids love being with my parents and Scott, Stacey and Mia.Â Everyone else were in the other house.</p>

<p>It was nice to just all hang out with the family for a week with no plans, obligations or schedules. Each day we woke up whenever we wanted to (or in our case, whenever our girls woke up) and did whatever we wanted to do. The only day with something scheduled was Sunday when all of us went to church. That's one thing that my family likes to do - wherever we vacation, if we're there on a Sunday we like to visit the local ward or branch. And they are usually shocked to have 25+ people visiting.</p>

<p>The girls loved playing in the sand and building sand forts or castles. Kenzie went out with Nate on the boogie board a few times. She though it was fun until she got water in her mouth. Then she was done. Laney wasn't her daring self where she ran directly into the ocean this time. She just kept to herself on the shore or splashed in the shallow water.</p>

<p>I have a ton of photos from our week long beach vacation so I'm breaking it up into two posts. Don't want to overwhelm you with photos.</p>

<p>The Sunday before fall semester finals week at BYU. Nate and I spent the evening with my aunt and uncle in Orem and their family. They have a Christmas tradition where they go around to each other's homes (this is a big extended family - kids, grandchildren, cousins, etc.) and look at each other's Christmas decorations. Then they pick a Christmas song they enjoy and we listen to the music while we enjoy their home decorated nicely. It was a nice evening with my family and it got us in the Christmas spirit.</p>
<p>Afterwards, we went back to my apartment and just hung out. We were sitting on the couch. My roommates weren't there. And it was just silent for a while. And I used to ask Nate all the time, "What are you thinking about?" whenever he was silent. But this time, he said, "You don't want to know." And of course that made me nervous, I had to know.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4045" title="pic 182 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/pic-182.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="550" /></p>
<p>So he said, "I was just thinking about what it would be like if we could cuddle on the couch like this forever." That was the first time Nate talked about us in terms of "forever". I mean I was noticing him using similar terms in his conversations a week or two before this but it was all hypothetical stuff. So I didn't think too much of it. I wasn't ready for marriage so I wasn't going to go there. This time he was more direct. I didn't want to expand on that statement. So I just let it be.</p>
<p>We sat there in silence for a while. Then Nate asked, "Have you ever thought about marrying me?" I honestly replied, "Umâ€¦ No. Have you thought about marrying me?" I didn't really want to know the answer to that because that would mean we were going to talk about marriage. I wasn't ready for that conversation yet. We had only been dating for 2 1/2 months. It seemed way too soon for this DTR (define the relationship). But he brought it up and that was what we were talking about. So I started thinking about marrying Nate.</p>
<p>We talked for the next while and by the end of the night, we had a date set. That was my part. I pulled out the calendar to see when would be a good time to get married since we were both in school. And since we didn't date very long, we thought May, after the winter semester, would be a good time to get married. Plus I always wanted a spring wedding. So that was that. What a way to head into finals week. We decided to keep this a secret between us. But we both felt really good about our decision to get married.</p>
<p>I was head over heels for Nate. He was everything I needed in my life and more. He was such an amazing guy. And since I had been proposed to previously and said no, I knew what a "no" felt like in a relationship. With Nate it was completely different. We prayed about it and just had a comfortable feeling about the whole thing. Even though I was the one holding back in the relationship, every time our relationship moved to the next level I was OK with it. I was hesitant at first but when I finally jumped with both feet in, I was OK with being with Nate. No warning signs.		</p>

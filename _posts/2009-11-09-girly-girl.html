<p>
				Girly girl is an understatement for Kenzie. Here is why…
<ul>
<li>She can cry on demand. Real tears and snot.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She has been in love with the color pink for as long as I could remember. In fact, she would be proud of the fact that she was born pink.</li>
<li>Disney princesses are her best friends. Just wait until she finds out there is a Disneyland… or a Disney World where princesses actually exists. There's a reason why we haven't told her about that.</li>
<li>She likes to pick out her clothes and change outfits several times a day. <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2009/11/future-fashion-designer/">Here's</a> a story about that.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She has a <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/10/laundry-list/">mental list</a> of things Nate does wrong around the house. And the list is ever growing.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She has moods and they definitely swing.&nbsp; </li>
<li>I asked her why she was wearing leggings by itself. She responded, "Because Daddy doesn't know how to pick out clothes for me."</li>
<li>She doesn't like to get dirty. No strolls in the grass for this girl. Oh no, she gets grass in her shoes then have to take them off to get the grass out.&nbsp;</li>
<li>There is a difference between shoes, glass slippers, and sandles. She will correct you on it.</li>
<li>She loves to wear high heels. The higher the better. That's why she loves to raid mom's closet.</li>
<li>She is particular about where things go. OK, so this one is more an offspring of my OCD.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She walks better in high heels than flip flops.&nbsp;</li>
<li>If you showed up unannounced at our house you can usually find Kenzie wearing one or all of the following (1) a tutu, (2) glass slippers, (3) a crown, (4) a dress/skirt, (5) jewelry, (6) something pink.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She has an interest in makeup and lipstick. She is bummed that her dad only allows her to wear clear Chapstick.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She likes to do the high pitch scream.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She has her dad wrapped around her finger.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Cat fights with Laney.</li>
<li>Thinks she is always right and bossy.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

				Kenzie runs up to me crying and tells meâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom! Laney won't let me play with any toys!</p>
<p>Tiffany: Laney won't let you play with <em>any</em> toys?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah. She got out the princesses she wanted from the princess bin then closed the bin so I can't get the princesses I want. She knows that I don't know how to open the bins.</p>
<p>Laney figured out a while ago how to open the clear plastic bins we use to contain their toys. The rule used to be they could only have 2 bins opened at a time to eliminate a huge mess all over the house. Well, ever since Laney figured out how to open the bins the rule went out the window. The thing is Kenzie haven't figured out how to open the bins yet.		</p>

<p>My first time ever making a homemade pie completely from scratch. Yes, crust and all. It wasn't as arduous as I had made it out to be in my mind. However, it was time consuming. Mostly the crust part. But it was the best piece of peach pie I have ever tasted. I can totally see why people make homemade pie rather than the frozen ones from the grocery store. I used peaches we purchased from the <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2010/09/alabama-farmers-market/" target="_blank">farmer's market</a> They kids enjoyed it too.</p>

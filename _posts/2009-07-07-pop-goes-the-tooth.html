<p>
				Laney's bottom right tooth finally cut through last Friday. I had the privilege of discovering this one since Nate discovered Kenzie's first tooth at 3 1/2 months old. Laney has been teething since she was 3 months old. Two months later, if finally came through with the bottom left one not far behind. Unfortunately, I haven't taken a picture of it.
<div></div>
<div>With the tooth came the talking. She's quite the chatter box and quite curious of everything. She wants to be right in the middle of everything and join Kenzie in whatever she maybe doing. I hope they become great friends and chat each other's ears off rather than mine. </div>

<div>Hopefully I'll post a picture soon. </div>

				After putting Kenzie down to bed, she says she needs to go potty. So I help her to the bathroom.</p>
<p>Kenzie: [noticing the bath toys and wash cloths on the floor in her bathroom] Mom, why are my letters and towels on the floor?<br />Tiffany: [doesn't know, so made something up] Because Daddy was cleaning the bath tub.<br />Kenzie: No he wasn't.<br />Tiffany: He wasn't?<br />Kenzie: He was washing the step stool and rinsing me because of my pee pee accident.<br />Tiffany: Oh, that's right.<br />Kenzie: I like pee pee accidents. I like getting my pee pee on everything.<br />Tiffany: What?! Big girls don't have accidents.<br />Kenzie: I like pee pee accidents because Daddy puts me in the tub and rinses me off. It's fun!<br />Tiffany: Oh, greatâ€¦</p>
<p>We had a little discussion on why big girls don't have accidents. And Kenzie haven't had an accident in months until the other day with Nate as she was brushing her teeth.		</p>

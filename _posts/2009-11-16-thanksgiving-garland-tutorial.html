<p>I made this Thanksgiving garland and put together a tutorial for everyone. Remember last year when I made the paper chain and had Kenzie tell me things she was grateful for? It was a countdown to Thanksgiving, too. Well, this year, I upgraded the paper chain for a nicer looking garland. Go to my <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2009/11/thanksgiving-garland/">SMM site</a> for the tutorial. </p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving!		</p>

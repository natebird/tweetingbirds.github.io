				For Father's Day I made a memory book for my dad (Dude) with some of our favorite memories with him from Nate, Jeffrey, Laney, Kenzie, and me. The following was one of the memories…</p>

Dad found out from the Smart car website that the cars were on tour. So we drove downtown and waited hours with other anxious drivers to test drive the new Smart FourTwo before it even came to the U.S. market. Since it was a hot summer day, we got water bottles with the Smart logo on it as we waited in line. The car was exciting to drive around for a few blocks. We also got a gift card to Whole Foods for filling out a survey about the car. So after driving the cars, we got a healthy lunch at Whole Foods with our gift cards. Mom was nice enough to watch Makenzie while we test drove the cars.</p>
<p>Dad has always had a love for cars. And although I don’t know much about cars, everything I do know about it I learned from him. How to wash it, take care of it, keep it clean, no finger prints on the windows, how to lift the hood, check the oil, how to change tires and brakes.		</p>

				Friday night I did a little grocery shopping run with a friend, Blair, and everything was great until I got home. As I got one of my grocery bags out of Blair's trunk, out came a jar of salsa from a ripped bag. It broke into a million pieces and salsa splattered all over our driveway, my shoes, and my pants. Too bad it was around 9 p.m. and below freezing temperature. Nate and I were out there picking up shattered glass and scooping up salsa. After getting rid of the big stuff, we had to hose down the driveway which quickly froze into an ice patch. How fun!</p>
<p>Then tonight, Kenzie got to stay up way past her bedtime caused by her accident. Nate had given her a bath and as he was drying her off, she decided to run around the house naked. Pretty cute... until she peed in our bathroom. Luckily it was in the bathroom (and on her favorite blanket and on Nate's side bathroom rug) and not in our carpet. However, since Kenzie can't sleep without her blanket (Nate tried and failed), I am having to do a load of laundry on Sunday and Nate is keeping her distracted from the fact that her blanket is in the laundry.		</p>

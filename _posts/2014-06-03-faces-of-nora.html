<p>
				This girl is pretty cute. I love to kiss those chubby cheeks. She is doing well and growing up pretty quick. She holds her head up pretty well. She was sleeping from 9 p.m. to 5 or 6 a.m. Then she had a couple of weeks where she woke up several times at night. That was rough. Now she is back to 9 to 5. Once she gets that down for a while I'll cut out the 5 a.m. And I had to throw in a picture of her chunky thigh. She is also doing pretty good at falling asleep at nap times on her own. She whines for a while, sometimes cries. But then she falls asleep. She has been getting up during her sleep cycle and the girls immediately starts to play with her instead of letting her go back to sleep. We are working on that. It is also making me nervous that she wants to suck on something to fall asleep sometimes. </p>

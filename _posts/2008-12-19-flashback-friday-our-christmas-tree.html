				As Nate and I put up our Christmas tree this year, I realized that it has been with our family for five years now, and still going strong. Nate and I bought the Christmas tree on a whim back when we were dating. We had been dating for two months at the time. I needed to take some pictures for a photo assignment in my photojournalism class. So we, Nate and I along with my friend, Julia and her husband, Josh, went to Wal-Mart in Orem to take pictures of them picking out an artificial Christmas tree. While we were there looking at the trees and decorations, Nate thought it would be fun to purchase one. We found a cheap one and bought it together.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUhLJa6J-cI/AAAAAAAAD2I/TdcD0y0DMOo/s1600-h/Picture+095.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Picture+095.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280553188306057666" /></a>I remember wondering at the time, who would get the tree if we broke up? Maybe we will just half it. I'll take top and he'll take bottom. Luckily, that never happened.</p>
<p>We put the tree in Nate's basement apartment, The Hole, to make the place a little more lively. I went out the next day to get some decorations for the tree. Later that December, the tree was featured in Nate's friends' wedding, Taylor and Julia. They used Christmas trees to decorate for their reception. <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUhLJwUqTyI/AAAAAAAAD2Y/8HYl6I2owjQ/s1600-h/Picture+037.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Picture+037.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280553194054373154" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUhLJouDMMI/AAAAAAAAD2Q/wzkVBZ7EHGo/s1600-h/Picture+002.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/Picture+002.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280553192013377730" /></a>		</p>

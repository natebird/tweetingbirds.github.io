<p>I am so blessed to have married into such a wonderful family. I love Nate's family so much. From the very beginning (when Nate finally decided to tell his mom about me), everyone in Nate's family accepted me and welcomed me as another member of the family.</p>
<p>I admire Nate's parents, Randy and Cyndi, for having EIGHT kids in 11 years. There was a point in time when FOUR of them were in diapers at the same time! They are saints and they have done such a wonderful job as parents. I am so glad to be a recipient of the results of their great parenting skills. Nate, the eldest, is the most wonderful husband in the world and I know it's because of the way he was raised.</p>
<p>Nate and I have completely different childhood stories. I grew up with just one brother while he had seven other siblings to keep the house busy. I love listening to all the stories of what it was like to be raised in a huge family - Nate taking his driver's license test in a Suburban, knocking the twins over with couch cushions, helping his dad build their house from scratch, all their attempts for a decent family vacation, his parents' many "we're having another kid" announcements, and so much more.</p>
<p>We love having Nate's family visit us. It's too bad his parents live across the country with siblings scattered throughout the Western states. It would be nice to see them more often. Good thing for video chats and free long distance phone calls! We try to video chat at least once a week with the family so they can see their only grandchild, Kenzie. And I talk to Cyndi every once in a while just to catch up with life.</p>
<p>And this time next week, the family will welcome a new addition to the family. Nate's brother, Nick, will be getting married in Arizona. I'm excited to have another in-law in the family, I've waited 4 1/2 years. Congratulations, Nick and Jessica!		</p>

And I'll go like thisâ€¦ [skipping and prancing around the room].</p>
<p>This year will be fun to take her trick-or-treating since she'll actually understand the concept of it. But it'll be hard to pry all the candy away from her sugar-hungry hands. Confession: I'm one of those lame moms who wishes our neighbors gave out healthy treats like pretzels and raisins. And we're handing out glow stick bracelets again this year.</span>		</p>

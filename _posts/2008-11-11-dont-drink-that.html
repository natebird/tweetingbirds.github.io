				I went in for my check up today at my OB and as usual, I had to pee in a cup. With my sidekick, Kenzie, by my side, we had this conversation in the bathroom at the OB office. I was keeping a quiet voice, but Kenzie was saying everything extremely loud.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mommy, you go pee pee in the toilet?<br />Tiffany: Yup.<br />Kenzie [seeing me put my name on a cup]: Mommy, you pee pee in a cup?<br />Tiffany: Yup.<br />Kenzie: You drink the pee pee in the cup?<br />Tiffany: Nope. It's for testing.<br />Kenzie: Oh, that's gross-y.		</p>

				We got home from our Disney trip (posting about it next week) really late Saturday night before Halloween. Technically it was 12:30 a.m., so it was Halloween Day when we pulled into our driveway. I wasn't sure if the kids in our neighborhood went trick-or-treating on Saturday or Sunday. Come Sunday, we had people knocking on the door. I was glad that our girls didn't miss trick-or-treating because we were driving home. But that also meant I didn't have any Halloween candy for the trick-or-treaters in our neighborhood. Ooops. I found some leftover candy from Kenzie's birthday party in August and some leftover glow sticks from 4th of July. Sorry kids. Next year I'll be better. You can read more about our Halloween <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2010/11/the-forgotten-halloween-2010/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<p>Our girls just wore their princess dresses from Disney. It was perfect. Nate took them around and they didn't even make through our little neighborhood. They did about 10 houses and were done. Good because I don't really give our kids candy to eat. And I don't eat chocolate. Nate is not a huge candy person either. So I need to find a way to get rid of the candy they did collect.</p>

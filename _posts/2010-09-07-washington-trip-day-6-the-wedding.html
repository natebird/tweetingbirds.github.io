<p>Saturday morning began with a breakfast in the mountains. Gorgeous views of the city where the Birds live. It was a nice and beautiful morning full of sunshine and reminded me of all the amazing things Heavenly Father has put into my life.</p>

<p>After a little picnic breakfast, we had scripture study together as a family while being surrounded by the natural beauty God created for us. It was sad to also realize that our week with Nate's family was ending soon.</p>

<p>Cyndi and Randy planned so many fun activities for us. We did not have one boring moment. We all loved it. I also love this picture of me and my girls. They are so cute.</p>

<p>Once we headed back down the mountain to play basketball back home. The Birds love basketball even though only one of the Bird boys played basketball in high school. They all have the height for it though. So we are starting our kids young into basketball too. Laney is the my girl who loves balls. So she got into basketball right away.</p>

<p>Kenzie liked making baskets, but then she went straight for the pom poms. She's my girly girl.</p>

<p>It was too bad that Nate and I didn't have room in our luggage for our basketball shoes so we had to get by with flip-flops and whatever else we did pack.</p>

<p>The remainder of the day we spent at a wedding. It was Nate's best friend from high school, Dave, who married another girl from their high school. They started dating just 3 years ago. So it was nice to be there for their wedding. It was a stunning wedding at a new Catholic church in town.</p>

<p>I enjoy going to non-Mormon weddings. It was a small wedding, very personal. It was a wonderful ceremony followed by a reception at a glamourous restaurant in a vineyard. Some of the best food I have ever had served at the wedding. We were so glad to share that special day with them. Here's Nate and some of his friends from high school. What a great group of friends. Nate was the only LDS person in his group of high school friends. And he was lucky to have such good group of guys who are just quality people.</p>

<p>And since we were all there and fancied up, we decided to snap a quick family photo.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1744" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-6-the-wedding/img_6491/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1744" title="IMG_6491 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6491.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>After we put the kids to bed, Nate and I went out just the two of us to a friend's house. It was a little gathering of their high school friends. It was nice to meet some of Nate's friends from high school and to see some of them again.		</p>

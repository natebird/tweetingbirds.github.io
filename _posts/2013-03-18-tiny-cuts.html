<p>Lai Lai, when she gets cuts, she bleeds for a long time. It's near impossible to get a bandaid on that girl. And once it's on, she will work her hardest to take it off within seconds. So pretty much I just pin her down, hold pressure to the cut until it stops bleeding. Luckily it only happened 3-4 times. </p>

				My dad's birthday was last Saturday. And for his birthday, I had the idea of surprising him at school on Friday. He teaches at an alternative school (where the bad kids who are kicked out of their regular school go). There were around 60 students in the entire school, then teachers and staff. So <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/12/making-dudepas-cupcakes/" target="_blank">we made over 100 cupcakes</a> to feed everyone in the school. Friday morning we picked up my mom and headed to school. We arrived a little before lunch.</p>

<p>My dad was so surprised. He was so excited we were there. He talks about us to his students all the time. They knew all about my mom, who they called Mama Kelly. She hates that. And they knew all about my website. And they knew all about Wei Wei (that's why my family calls Kenzie) and Laney. We took the cupcakes to lunch where my dad handed them out the each of the students. They all asked him, "Dr. Rob, how old are you?" He responded, "36" or "43". Those kids are so gullible. I also had all the kids sing him happy birthday just to embarrass him.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2580" title="IMG_1727 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1727.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2579" title="IMG_1726 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1726.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>The girls had a great time hanging out in my dad's classroom.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2576" title="IMG_1683 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1683.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2577" title="IMG_1696 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1696.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>They also tried to play chess in the platinum student lounge. That's the kind of chess pieces I need. Ones that tells you what each piece can do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2581" title="IMG_1732 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1732.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2582" title="IMG_1734 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1734.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Then we hung out at my parents house. Nate met us over there. My mom did a Chinese hot pot for dinner that night. It was delicious and great conversations. It was a great day for all of us.		</p>

				I am so behind on posts that I don't know where to start. So the best thing to do is just start anywhere, right? Before Christmas we did our <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/12/2011-family-pictures/" target="_blank">family pictures</a> for the Christmas cards. Well, we told the girls if they would just cooperate during the not-so-fun photo conditions we would go to Chick-Fil-A for lunch. The day we went to take pictures was cold and windy. And since I set up with a tripod and timer, there were several attempts at getting one good picture. They suffered through the family pictures and got their reward. We went to Chick-Fli-A for lunch. They loved it. And this restaurant had a playground. The girls actually played in it. Our girls had a fear of playing on the playground at the park or at restaurants. They didn't used to climb up on the playground slides and such. But this time they did. And they had a wonderful time doing it. They didn't want to go home.</p>

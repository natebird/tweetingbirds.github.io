I LOVE So You Think You Can Dance! I love dance, especially I have always done some kind of dance since I was 5. I started watching at the beginning of last season, and watched every episode, even while I was on vacation last summer at the beach.</p>
<p>Last night was the 2-hour premiere of the show and it was awesome! The auditions began in L.A. with some amazing dancers and some really bad ones. Some of the bad ones have been on the show before, but they keep trying, probably just to get some TV attention. But so many of these dancers are so inspirational, like one last night who has very limited eye sight. I love the judges, even if they are mean sometimes. I am sad that this year Wade Robson and Shane Sparks will not be choreographers this season, they were my favorite choreographers.</p>
<p>The next episode it another 2-hour show with auditions in Salt Lake City and Texas. It's on Monday at 8 p.m. I'll have to make sure I'm home in time to watch it!		</p>

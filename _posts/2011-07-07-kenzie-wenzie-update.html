<p>Makes me sad that she's so old and growing older each day.</p>
<ul>
<li>She will be starting kindergarten in the fall. She is so excited about it. She will do good in school. I think Laney and I will have a harder time with her being gone during the day.</li>
<li>She is orderly and likes to have things done a certain way - usually her way. This is a problem with Laney since Laney does things in her own unique way.</li>
<li>Things are black and white in her eyes. It's either right or wrong.</li>
<li>We've been having problems with her physically bullying Laney around - hitting, kicking, pushing, shoving, etc. We're working with her on that.</li>
<li>She is emotional about everything. And she dramatizes her emotions.</li>
<li>She is learning to count her numbers up to 100 and read them too.</li>
<li>She can read short words - 5 letter words.</li>
<li>She memorizes brands and logos. When we drive around, she can identify stores and restaurants.</li>
<li>We had her eyes checked and she has eyes like me. It looks like she will be nearsighted like me.</li>
<li>Dances and does ballet poses everywhere we go. Ballet has definitely helped her become more graceful with her body.</li>
<li>Very obedient child. She will do whatever is asked.</li>
<li>Has a hard time eating dinner and sometimes lunch. She doesn't care much about food. She is picky with her food. Doesn't eat peels on apples, potatoes, pears, etc. She is aware of how the food looks and its textures. Takes her forever to finishing a meal.</li>
<li>Starting to take interest in Barbies.</li>
<li>Likes to tattle tell on her sister.</li>
<li>Showing signs that she may be gifted. We'll see how she does when she starts school.</li>
<li>Great at drawing and creating stories.</li>
<li>Wants to be a writer, a scientist and a ballerina teacher when she grows up.</li>
<li>Has memorized some words (the spelling) and is able to write them on her own without looking at anything.</li>
<li>Remembers everything… like things from when she was 2 or 3 years old.</li>
<li>Is tall and skinny. Long skinny legs. It's hard to find clothes for her. She wears 4T-5T for the length but it's usually too wide on her (shirts, definitely pants, and dresses). I've started to purchase some girl sized clothes for her… sad that she's not in toddler size any more.</li>
</ul>

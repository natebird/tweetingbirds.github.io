<p>
				Thursday afternoon began the weekend celebration of Nate's sisters' graduations for Natalie and Nicole. Yes, all of Nate's siblings have similar names- Nathan, Nicholas, Natalie, Nicole, Matthew, Mitchell, Michael, Michelle. We "missed" commencement with Elder Bednar speaking because Kenzie was still napping. She never did adjust to Utah time the whole week we were there. Toward the end of the week, I didn't see a purpose in continuing trying to get her to adjust to the two hour difference. Nate wasn't too upset about missing commencement. Instead, we met up with his family at the graduation celebration at the new Hinckley Alumni Building. The place was gorgeous, a lot better and bigger than the old alumni building.</p>
<p>The graduation celebration was for graduates and their families, costing $15-$20/person to prevent all several thousands of graduate from coming. It was supposed to have a live band, dancing, dinner, and fireworks. Considering the cost and the semi formal dress attire, one would expect it to be a nice elegant event. The event was sold out, so by the time we arrived with all 12 of us, there were very few seating and no opened tables. There were three buffet lines - Hawaiian, Mexican, and American food. We were able to find half a round table available where we rotated sitting and eating. The band was great and a lot of people danced. However, the fireworks canceled due to the snowy and windy weather.  Although the seating arrangements were disappointing, we were able to have lots of fun visiting with Nate's family and dance the night away.</p>
<p>Of course, being the only grandchild of Randy and Cyndi, Kenzie receive more than enough attention to last her the rest of her life from all her aunts, uncles, grandparents, great grand parents, and other extended family. She was pretty much the only kid any time we were with Nate's family.</p>
<p>On Friday, Nate's family wanted to have a picnic at Kawanis Park in Provo. Having had snow the day before, the day at the park was still quite chilly mostly with strong winds. We had the picnic until Kenzie's nap time. We then took her back to our friends' house, Grant and Kelly Memmott, where we were staying that night. It was great because Victoria, Grand and Kelly's daughter, had the same sleeping schedule as Kenzie. So they would nap together and went to bed at night at the same time.</p>
<p>Friday night was Natalie and Nicole's humanities school graduation at the Marriott Center. We were late for that due to Kenzie' nap again. We kept her on a full activities schedule all day long and kept her up at night hoping she would adjust to the time change, but she never did. So we would let her nap a full two hours to prevent a grouchy kid. Once again, Nate wasn't too concerned about missing the speakers and musical numbers at the beginning of the graduation program. If you can't tell, Nate is not big into graduations. His mom and I had to talk him into even attending his own graduation. We arrived in time for the last speaker and watched his sisters walked across the stage to receive their fake diplomas. Afterwards we had family pictures taken outside the Marriott Center. This was one of the main reason for our presence in this Utah trip. Cyndi wanted four generation family pictures with Kenzie.</p>

<p>With uncle Nick, who she loves even though Nate's sisters were trying to convince Kenzie that Nick was bad. Kenzie did say Nick's name before any of Nate's other siblings' names.</p>

<p>Nate and Tiffany! And Nate is not drunk here even though he looks like he may be. It's a BYU celebration, the hardest drink they had was lemonade!</p>

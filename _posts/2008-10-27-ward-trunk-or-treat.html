It had been rainy, cold, and windy all day. There was a huge turn out from the ward. And the YW service auction got quite the attention with over 250 cans collected and each girl had at least one service bought. Lots of yummy chili and pies for the cook-offs. And the trunk-or-treat ended up being outside even though it was still drizzling. Luckily, I had an umbrella in the car.</p>
<p>Kenzie was excited to dress up as Piglet all day. But when time came, it took a lot of coaxing to get her to actually dress up. She insisted on being Piglet this year even though the costume was a bit small, it was a 12 month size. We made due with some long pink socks. She did get into the whole trick-or-treating thing once she saw people put candy in her bucket. The trunk-or-treat didn't last very long since it was cold and wet outside. Overall she had a great time and is still talking about it today.</p>

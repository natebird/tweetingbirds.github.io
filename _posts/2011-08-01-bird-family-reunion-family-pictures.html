				So all in all, there were 24 people staying in Nate's parents' house for this reunion. The original 10 (Nate's parents and the 8 children, Nate being the eldest), 6 in-laws and future in-laws, 4 grandchildren (our two girls and the two boys born last October and November), grandma and grandpa Roos (Nate's mom's parents), grandma Bird and aunt Debi (Nate's dad's mom and sister). It's a good thing Nate's parents have a big house.</p>
<p>There were many photo opportunities because we wanted to capture every moment. Nate's parents hired their professional photographer (he has been doing the Bird family portraits since Nate was in elementary school) to do family portraits of just the original Birds, no in-laws or future in-laws.</p>

<p>And the in-laws/future in-laws on the side watching and forming an in-law support group…</p>

<p>And then they had me take some unofficial family photos with everyone throughout the reunion. The ones with me in it are done using a tripod. Believe me, it was funny to watch an 8-month pregnant woman set up the tripod and timer then make a mad-dash to be in the photo. Let's just say 10 seconds wasn't enough for me to make it to the first few. Luckily my camera does continuous shots. A remote would have come in handy.</p>
<p>Everyone with their family reunion shirts on Saturday, the first day everyone were together because Nate's sister Nicole and her boyfriend, Alex, flew in that morning. It's hard to see the reunion shirt in the photo. I'll have to try to get a close up of it later. There are a lot of Birds, no?</p>
<p>All these pictures were taken around the Bird house, mostly in their yard or orchard. Isn't it nice? They have beautiful views.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4179" title="IMG_7861 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7861.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="348" /></p>
<p>The original Birds. Don't be fooled by the photo. They are all quite tall with the tallest being a little over 6'6" and shortest 5'6". That's one happy pair of parents to have all EIGHT children home again.</p>

<p>This is after church on Sunday when we took these pictures. These are the girls of the family and they sang beautifully at church in sacrament. The twins spoke in sacrament reporting their missions. And since the ward had been split and some people moving out, we almost doubled the ward taking up 3 middle bench rows in sacrament with our 24 family members.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4205" title="IMG_8015 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8015.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="411" /></p>
<p>Even Nate's sisters got some height on them… Michelle, the youngest being the tallest at 5'10".</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4206" title="IMG_8021 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8021.jpg" alt="" width="370" height="550" /></p>
<p>The handsome twins who had just gotten home from their missions the previous week. Michael served in Chile Concepcion Mission and Mitchell served in Honduras San Pedro Sula Mission. That was the first time the twins had been apart. Were they glad to be back together again. They will both be in Provo for school in the fall.</p>

<p>All the boys in the family who has served a mission, which was all of them. Nate looks a little baggy in his suit because he was wearing his dad's for the photo. He was the only one who didn't pack a suit for church. They are standing in line of age from left (Nate's dad) to right. And the last three bring the tallest in the family. Ha!</p>

<p>All the Birds who have served missions. Yes, they put seven of the eight kids on missions. In fact, they had four kids on missions at the same time at one point. Michelle, the youngest, is not old enough to go yet and she is also getting married this August.</p>

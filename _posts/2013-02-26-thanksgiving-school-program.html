				Kenzie's school had a little program they did in class for Thanksgiving. It was short and cute. Then we had breakfast afterwards. Later that day, Nate went into her class as the surprise mystery reader. He dressed up as Nate the Great and read a Nate the Great book. It's funny because Kenzie said that she told her friends at school that her dad is a real life detective. She's going to think his job is really boring when she realizes what her dad does for a living. </p>
<p>Then for Thanksgiving, we had it at Scott and Stacey's house this year. Grandpa wasn't feeling well so they didn't even come. We only had a few families there. Beau and Candace were there and Candace's aunt and uncle came too. It was low key and nice. The girls played with some of their cousins, although majority of their cousins moved away. They are still sad about that. It was a nice Thanksgiving though and I ate a lot of yummy foods. </p>

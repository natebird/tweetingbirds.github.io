				These were the family pictures I took of us for our Christmas cards last year. They turned out decent considering it was a really cold and wet Saturday morning when we went out to take the pictures. It was actually drizzling a bit in the picture, just can't see the rain. The girls were troopers. We got it done in half an hour at two different locations. This year I got a wireless remote that worked fabulous. I love my wireless remote! It made it so much quicker to take the picture.</p>

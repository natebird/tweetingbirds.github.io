				A couple of weeks ago, Nate received a phone call from a recruiter he had used previously to find jobs. He told Nate that he submitted Nate's old resume to a company and they wanted to interview him. Thinking it couldn't hurt, Nate went in for the interview. It went extremely well and the company loved Nate and immediately gave him an offer.</p>
<p>Some of concerns we had was the commute. It's an additional 15-20 minutes one way from where Nate works now. And Nate enjoys where he is working right now. His company now is very family friendly and flexible for his schedule. He could work from home sometimes when I have things going on (doctor appointments) and he can set his own schedule. And the biggest thing about his current job is his boss, John. Nate loves working for John. He's an amazing guy.</p>
<p>The new job was giving him a pretty good pay offer which can help us pay off his student loans. He will get to work with another Ruby developer he can learn from. And he will get to actually develop rather than do maintenance like his current job. But the risky thing is the company is a startup company that has been around for several years. And it's being funded by St. Judes Hospital. Eventually St. Judes wants to buy out the company. But we've heard that Nate's position will be pretty safe when the company is bought out. So it was a hard choice.</p>
<p>In the end, Nate decided to set his terms and see if the new job would give him what he wanted. Nate enjoys working from 7-3 so he misses traffic and he gets home at a decent time to see the girls a few hours before they go to bed. The recruiter said the new company accepted all of Nate's terms without a blink. So we decided to accept the job.</p>
<p>It was hard for Nate to tell his current boss that he was leaving. John was sad Nate was leaving but he understood that with a growing family we needed to do what was best for us. And Nate's current job isn't able to match the pay increase the new job was offering. So he put in his two weeks notice. Today is actually Nate's first day at his job.</p>
<p>The cool thing about Nate's new job is the company is developing a device for the heart. And we've been learning so much about the heart with Lai Lai. So it is very interesting. Here's to a new job and a new chapter in our lives.		</p>

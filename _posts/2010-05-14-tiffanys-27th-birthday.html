<p>Happy belated birthday to me. I turned 27 this year on April 26. Nate let me have the morning off and I went shopping by myself. It was nice. And I purchased 3 pairs of shoes for $40. Awesome because I needed new shoes.</p>
<p>Then for dinner, we drove the hour over to Red Robin to get our free birthday burgers. Since Nate and my birthdays are so close together, we could actually use both of our birthday coupons together. So we just purchased kids meals (Red Robin has awesome kids meals for a great price) and that was it. Afterwards, we went over to their Barnes and Noble next to Red Robin and walked around looking at books. Then drove the hour back.</p>
<p>It was a nice birthday and Nate and I also discovered Milton, Georgia. That's where we want to move to next. Such a lovely place.		</p>

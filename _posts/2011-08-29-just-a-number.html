				Kenzie: Mom, I know what we can name the baby. How about we name her a number, like 40-10?</p>
<p>I think Nate and I finally have a couple names in the bag for the new baby. But still indecisive. It's mostly me. I think this time around I want to meet the baby first before I finalize on a name. We'll let you know when that happen.</p>
<p>P.S. Today is my official due date.		</p>

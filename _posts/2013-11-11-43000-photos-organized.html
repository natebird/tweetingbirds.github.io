<p>I have been working on this project since January of this year. I've been working on it on and off because I get sick of doing it then I get back on the wagon. But it was also a lot of photos to go through, delete, and tag with keywords so they are all organized. I ended up cutting the photos by almost half by deleting a bunch of photos that weren't good. It was also interesting to go back an see how my photography skills have evolved throughout the years. I noticed that I used to take a lot more picture when I got my first DSLR (Canon Rebel T1i). And it was also able to see the picture quality difference after getting my L series lenses and again after getting my new camera.</p>
<p>It was also fun to go through and see all the pictures of the girls. I discovered that Lai Lai and Kenzie look a lot alike around the same age. There are so many things I was so glad I captured on camera. We have been so blessed and have so much fun together as a family. And we've done quite a bit of traveling too. I love it.</p>

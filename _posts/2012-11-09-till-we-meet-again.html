<p>Ugh. It has been a long day. Everything was going normal and fine until around 10 something or maybe it was around 11 a.m. today. I can't really remember. But my dad called me, which doesn't happen often because he's a teacher at school and he should be working. I answered the phone and he said, "Did you hear about Barron?" He proceeded to tell me that yesterday Barron had fallen of a high ladder while cutting down a tree top in their yard. They think that the large branch that he cut might have hit him and caused him to fall off the ladder. They think he broke his neck when he hit the ground. Completely crazy.</p>
<p>Irene didn't find his body until this morning. She got home after dark last night so she didn't see him then. She thought he was out with my dad, which isn't unusual. But then she started getting worried when he didn't come home. She kept calling his phone and leaving messages. She woke up a few times last night and called him. No answer. Then as she was leaving this morning to teach at the gym, she found his body. She called 911 then called Stacey. Stacey and Scott showed up before the ambulance and saw his body there.</p>
<p>I am still in shock. At first I thought this was a mean joke my dad was playing on me. But then it started to sink in. Cannot believe it. There's no way something like this can happen, especially to Barron. The world lost a great man today. Full of positive spirit and love and one of the kindest person I know. I keep thinking in the back of my mind that he's just going to show up tonight like it was just a nightmare.</p>
<p>I had the girls eating lunch when my dad called. I didn't give them much time to finish, packed some snacks and toys in a bag and loaded the two youngest kids in the car headed toward Irene's house. I didn't know what else to do other than to be there. Scott and Stacey had been there since immediately after Irene called. My dad received the phone call this morning at school and he rushed over to Irene's house. Barron's parents and siblings were there. Other close friends were also there helping out with funeral arrangements and such.</p>
<p>Been crying all day. Haven't stopped crying. Still crying as I am writing this. I just can't imagine his family. Being there with Barron's parents, crying on their shoulders and giving hugs. And Irene. That girl deserves the world. Those two were amazing together. It's so weird because we were just talking about Thanksgiving plans and getting together for the holidays. We were just at the GT football game with them two weekends ago. So glad we had more times lately to spend time with them before this happened.</p>
<p>Also feel bad for my dad for losing his best friend. Team TOM (Tough Old Men). They spent so much time together and had so much fun together. Since this was all unexpected and Barron passed away at such a young age of 53, they had no plans for when he was to pass away. But my dad did say that on their many hikes, they would hike often by a cemetery not too far from Barron's house. And he had mentioned that he would like to be buried there. So my dad took Barron's family there to check it out. Irene agreed and he will be buried there next week. The place was so Barron.</p>
<p>Everyone loved Barron. He had such a fun personality and a good sense of humor. He remembers little details about everyone and made everyone feel like they were his best friend. He was in my ward when I was in high school and while I was away at college. But one summer after a year at BYU, I came home and gave a talk in sacrament meeting. Years later when we were in the same ward again, but this time a different ward, he remembered the talk I had given years ago. He was so good with children. He would let them hang on him and he was so good at playing with them, giving them attention. Our girls absolutely loved him like he was their grandpa. He was such a scholar with the scriptures. He can quote scriptures like crazy. He was a virtuous man with high integrity.</p>
<p>We love the Smith family so much. It has been fun getting to know them and spending so much time with them. They are family to us. 'Till we meet again, Barron. You will be forever remembered.</p>
<p>These are pictures from the last time we spent time with Barron, at the GT football game. Here's me taking a picture of Barron taking a picture of me. And the one below if all of us going out to eat dinner after the game.</p>

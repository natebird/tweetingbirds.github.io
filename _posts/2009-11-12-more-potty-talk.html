				Kenzie: Mom, I am getting too big for my potty seat.<br />Tiffany: Oh yeah?<br />Kenzie: I am getting too big. When I was smaller, I could use my potty seat. But now I am this much bigger. I don't want to use the potty seat anymore because I like to sit on the big seat and use my hands to hold me up. Next time I will put my small potty seat on the hook and sit on the big one.		</p>

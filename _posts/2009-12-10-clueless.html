				This was way too cute, I had to post about this even though it'll embarrass Nate a little. Last Friday while I was at the YW sleepover, I received a phone call from Nate. He usually doesn't call me while I'm doing church stuff unless it was an emergency or he had a question about the kids. So when he called, I answered. The YW had gone downstairs to the basement to hang out without the adults and I was just about to leave.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany:</b> Hey honey, what's going on?<br /><b>Nate: </b>I was just wondering what do I need to do to put the sheets in the washer?<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> What? I don't get what you are asking. [Because I'm the one who does all the laundry in our household.]<br /><b>Nate:</b> How do I wash our sheets?<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> [still puzzled] Why are you trying to do the laundry?<br /><b>Nate:</b> So I can make our bed.<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> Umâ€¦ You put the dirty sheets in the washer and put detergent in it then turn it on.<br /><b>Nate:</b> How much detergent do I put in there?<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> Half a cup. You know, we do have another set of clean sheets.<br /><b>Nate:</b> Really? Where is it?<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> In the linen closet in our bathroom.<br /><b>Nate:</b> Oh. OK. [laughing at himself] And don't tell anyone about this.<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> Don't worry, Sherry is only standing right here next to me. [We're both laughing.]</p>
<p>Sherry is one of the YW's moms and our Relief Society President in our ward.		</p>

				So a lot has been happening and I am trying to catch up on blog posts again. Life has been going at full speed for sure. Here's a bit of what we have been doing. Some may or may not be in later posts with pictures. It seems like it has just been one thing after another and several things at once. Life is really challenging us right now.</p>
<ul>
<li>A week before Thanksgiving my mom found out she has cancer again after being cancer free for five years. She had been coughing and when she went to the doctor, they did an x-ray. They found spots in her lungs. So they had her do a PET scan. The results came back with stage 4 terminal cancer in her lungs and two cancerous spots in her spine, one up by her neck and one in her lower back. This is the same cervical cancer that she had previously, just this time it came back in her lungs. The doctors gave her life expectancy of 3-6 months without chemo treatments and 1-2 years with treatments. Her cancer is too far along to do radiation. However, they did do radiation on the cancerous spot by her neck to relieve some pain she had been having. She started with her first chemo treatment shortly after Christmas. She started losing hair rapidly last week. This was hard news to take since we have been going through all this with Nate's dad for the last two years. The thought of Nate and I both losing a parent within this year and next is pretty hard. But we just turn to the Lord and know that this is all part of His plan whether we like it or not.</li>
<li>Nate's dad is still hanging in there for now. He actually been sounding pretty good lately while we talk or video chat with him. He is still on hospice at home with a nurse coming in each day to check on him. But he had been sitting vertically and even walking to the fridge lately. He says he is feeling pretty good. He is very thin though. His blood clot in his leg went away. They also switched him from pain patch to pills that are cheaper and working better. He didn't make it to Mitchell's wedding on Jan. 3 (Nate didn't either). But Cyndi was able to leave him with help of friends who stayed with him the four days she was gone to Colorado for the wedding. This continues to be a daily struggle and emotional roller coaster for Cyndi. We try to keep in touch with them by texting them and sending them pictures of the girls and things we are doing. And the girls have been drawing pictures and cards that we mail to them. We still haven't told the girls that Grandpa is dying. We will do that when it actually happens. There is no point for them to worry about his mortality until he is actually gone. For now they know he is very sick and we constantly pray for him and my mom.</li>
<li>Nate has been working ridiculous hours and through the weekends. It has been a bit difficult for us this holiday season as Nate started working 14-15 hour days since beginning of November. When he was going into the office, he would leave at 6 a.m. and get home after 9 p.m. But during the Christmas break, he started working from home which saved him commute time and cost. he would go into the office once or twice a week. But at home he actually worked more hours. He got up before 7 a.m. to start working then stop around dinner time. And then go back to work after the kids were in bed until 11 p.m. or midnight. His work moved his original March deadline to January 15. So he's doing three months worth of work in six weeks. He had originally planned on taking several days off during the Christmas break so we can spend time as a family and do stuff with the kids while they didn't have school or activities. But he couldn't do that anymore with the new deadline. He was only able to take Christmas Eve and Christmas day off. He worked New Year's Eve and New Year Day. He is supposedly getting comp for those holidays he worked. He is hoping to use them when we have the baby since neither one of our moms will be here to help us. And he is supposed to be getting a big bonus from all this but we'll see how much it actually comes out to be. I cannot wait for him to be done with this project and be home at regular hours. I am tired of being a single mom, especially while pregnant.Â <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7972" alt="131115_00001" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131115_00001.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></li>
<li>I am still pregnant. The baby is growing well, moving a lot, and getting hiccups often. I did find out I have gestational diabetes again with this one. I had it with Laney but not with the other two. It must be something with winter babies! I am getting bigger and definitely showing a lot now. Only seven more weeks left. I am eager to not be pregnant any more! But I'm not prepared at all for when the baby does arrive. We still need to rearrange our room to fit the crib. We still don't have a name. I'm just so noncommittal to any names. I have been crocheting hats for her for photo shoots. And we had to get a new car seat for her since the last one broke after three kids. I was hoping we wouldn't have to purchase a new car seat. Oh well. I have no idea how I will handle running the kids to all their various stuff with a new baby and our schedules around her schedule. I'm hoping Nate will be able to take a lot of time off during that time to help out since our moms won't be able to help. I'm a bit nervous about that part. And I am also hoping she comes a week early because my actual due date is the Friday of winter break. I would rather her come early so we have a full week of not having to run around to school and activities. We'll see.</li>
<li>Nate's work is awaiting FDA approval to come in. They have been approved, but it's when it officially goes through is when they will launch commercially. And when that happens, the company is being bought out by St. Jude's. Nate doesn't want to stick around much longer after that happens. He doesn't want to work for St. Jude's. So at that time he will look for a new job again. Because of all this, we are not able to plan much as to what we will do this year. We would like to move to a bigger house but we can't sell our house and renting out our house is not really a good option for us either but we might have to. We want to see what his new job will be before we make any big moves. And we need to figure out what to do with our house. Until then we make due with the amount of space we have here. It's a big cramped but financially it's the best decision to stay here.</li>
<li>Nate's brother, Mitchell, got married on Jan. 3rd in Colorado. He was planning on going to the wedding. Just him. But then he couldn't because of work. He was sad to have missed the wedding. Nate's dad and Grandma Bird also missed the wedding. Now only one Bird left who is not married. But he will probably get married this summer.</li>
<li>All of a sudden we have been receiving news about people we know or family members with cancer. We knew last year that Nate's Grandma Bird has lung cancer. She is not doing any sort of treatments for it. Also found out last year when we were in Utah that my Aunt Lorna has cancer. She is also not doing any treatments. Then just recently found out that my dad's cousin, West, has cancer too. And he is pretty young like in his late 40s or early 50s. And a few family friends here and there are also battling the beast. It's so crazy how many people we know have cancer!</li>
<li>I've stopped blogging on Simply Modern Mom since August or September. I just can't keep up with it while doing everything else. I do miss it sometimes but other times I am glad I am not tied down to a blog. We'll see if I pick it up this year. I have been doing some crafting during the holiday break. It was nice to be crafty again.</li>
<li>I was sick for three weeks straight in December. Each week with sometime different. The first week started the Saturday after Thanksgiving. I got the stomach virus that lasted a week. Then the next week was a cold. And the following week I picked up another strain of the cold when Kenzie came home from school with a fever. But because I am pregnant and my immune system is down I caught everything and it lasted much longer than usual. I was lucky we all were good before Christmas. Now school is starting again and I just can't imagine what else will be coming home. I know right before school got out for Christmas break kids at school were dropping like flies. The nurse was keeping a tally of what kids were being sent home for. There was the flu, cold and stomach virus going around. I kept Kenzie out of school the last two days before break because I didn't want her coming home with something else and loading on sugar with all the school celebrations.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's all for now. Everything else will be in later posts.		</p>

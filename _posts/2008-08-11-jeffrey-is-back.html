He spent the last two years serving in the Utah Ogden Mission where he worked diligently and had great success. We are so happy to have him back. Now he's looking for a job and beginning his journey toward the rest of his life (school, work, family, and so forth). The past few days has been an adjusting period for him.</p>
<p>We got him back on a cell phone. He'll be looking for a car once he finds a job. Jeffrey spent the night at our house last Friday where he watched four movies within a 24 hour period. Kenzie has enjoyed having another person to play with and give her lots of attention. This was the first time she has met her uncle Jeffrey since he departed for his mission just seven days before her birth.</p>
<p>We were able to attend the sacrament meeting at my parents' ward to hear Jeffrey speak (after attending our ward). And stayed for his open house at my parents' house last night.		</p>

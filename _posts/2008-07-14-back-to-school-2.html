				Back to school, to prove to Dad that I'm not a fool. I got my lunch packed up, my boots tied tight, I hope I don't get in a fight. Ohhhh, back to school.</p>
<p>Nate has been accepted to the evening MBA program! They are ranked 29 for top MBA programs, tied with BYU, except Nate's school accepts about half the number of applicants each year and costing twice as much compared to BYU. So yay for Nate for getting in this year! He'll start around mid-August while keeping his day job. It'll be nice because he will not be stuck in traffic since his classes will be from 6 to 9 p.m. going against traffic.</p>
<p>It'll be an interesting year with a baby coming and Nate being away from home more with work and school. And we'll probably have to look into getting another car since he'll have our car at work and school. That's not going to be fun. We'll be starting a Back to School Fund for Nate.		</p>

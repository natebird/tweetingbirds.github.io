				Alright. We're having a hard time with Lorelai's nickname. We don't want Lori or Lora to be her nickname. Nate thought of Rorie, which I liked, but if you have ever seen the show Gilmore Girls, you could understand why I wouldn't want to call her Rorie. I liked the show, but not that much where I want to name my daughter with names from the two main characters from the show. We thought of Lai Lai in the hospital but it's kind of a trendy name going around right now and it's hard to see where Lai Lai stems off of Lorelai.</p>
<p>Any ideas for nicknames for her?</p>
<p>I call her Lai Lai. Kenzie calls her Lore.		</p>

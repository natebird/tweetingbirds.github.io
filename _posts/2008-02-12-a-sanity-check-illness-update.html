				Kenzie has been grouchy all day with being sick, whining and crying for Mommy. She didn't want to eat anything, didn't want me to suck out her nose with the bulb or put saline drops in her nose, didn't want to drink water, didn't want to nap, didn't want to play, just wanted to whine and cry all day. She still had a fever, runny nose, and cough. Tylenol was able to get her fever down and once her fever broke, she got into a much better mood. However, she didn't want me to cook dinner. She wanted me to hold her instead. I managed to make dinner only burning myself with boiling water once, as a little girl tugged at my leg the throughout the whole process of cutting, washing, and cooking.</p>
<p>The whole house is a wreck with toys everywhere, all of Kenzie's rejected food displayed on the dining room table and on her highchair and kitchen counter, dirty dishes piled up in the sink, and just things everywhere. I am tired because I was up with Kenzie last night as she couldn't sleep with the constant coughing and hunger. Nate worked until 7 p.m. and is helping me watch Kenzie for a little bit while I type up this post. I hope after putting Kenzie to sleep and after picking up the house, I will have a few minutes to dive into my book before falling fast asleep... and I hope Kenzie feels better tomorrow.		</p>

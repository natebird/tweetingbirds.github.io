<p>Among all the activities and things planned for the reunion, I thought it would be fun for all the ladies of the Bird household to go out one afternoon. Just the ladies. So I talked to Nate's sisters and we planned to take an afternoon off leaving the children with our husbands. We had Nate's mom, grandma and aunt come with us since they are ladies too. I'm sure Nate's mom needed a break from hosting and just have some time off to relax with the girls. We all had a blast.</p>

<p>First we drove to downtown and went to an old fashion pharmacy soda shop where they had delicious ice cream, choose your flavor specialty sodas and milkshakes. It was so refreshing. I love old shops like that. There were nine of us girls and we took up pretty much their entire bar.</p>

<p>Then afterwards we walked around downtown and shopped around in a couple of the fun stores there. First we went to a kitchen store that was full of fun stuff. Then we went to an antique shop where they had a ton of cute vintage hats and other fun stuff. I think just about all of us walked out with something. I bought a couple vintage prints to frame for our house.</p>

<p>Those few hours out was much needed for us ladies. And the guys were so great about watching the kids and holding down the fort at home. When we came home, we found them all doing thisâ€¦</p>

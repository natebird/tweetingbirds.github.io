				Technically, it's her second day since we went to my dad's school another time when she was 9 months old. This time, my mom and I decided to surprise my dad with a visit to his last period class. We got there around 2 p.m. Kenzie loved it! She kept saying "school" and wanted to do whatever the students were doing. Kenzie was the center of attention with all the students and faculty. We were just there for about an hour and this is what she did.</p>
<p>By the way, for those of you who don't know, my dad teaches social studies at an alternative school. It's a school for middle and high school students who are dismissed from their home school for some kind of disciplinary problem. This school is usually their last resort to correct their behaviors before ending up in jail or prison. It's not the kind of school Kenzie wants to end up in, but she did like the concept and atmosphere of school.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R5JaMi65_fI/AAAAAAAABHw/U8ysNX5bb88/s1600-h/IMG_7176.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7176.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5157283694871444978" /></a><br />Kenzie and her lunch bag I packed for her for school.</p>

She did have a great time throwing that basketball around with her Dudepa and mom.</p>

Funny how the #1 rule is honesty... you should hear some of the "stories" he tells his students.		</p>

				This is the first time Kenzie has gone to the doctor's office and had a horrible time. First of all, she is sick with a cold and fever. She started coughing Saturday and got a fever Sunday night of 101. Tylenol got her fever down to 100 yesterday morning. I took her in yesterday morning for her 18 month wellness checkup. Yup, she turned 18 months last Saturday, the 9th. She is now old enough for nursery at church. But I didn't put her in this last Sunday because she had a cough and clear runny nose. I didn't want her to get other kids sick... it irritates me when parents put their sick kids in nursery. It's not worth it for me to put Kenzie in there for her to get germs and be sick the rest of the week.</p>
<p>Anyway, back to her doctor visit story, Kenzie woke up being all emotional, a total girl thing, but also because she isn't feeling good. We got to the doctor's office just fine. As we were waiting in the lobby for the nurse to call us, we witnessed lots of other sick kids, even one who threw up in the lobby as he was leaving the office. The flu is going around, everyone we know has at least one sick person in the family. When the nurse called Kenzie and walked us to a room, Kenzie started getting panicky and didn't want to go into the room.</p>
<p>The nice nurse tried to get her temperature, her head circumference, weight, and height. Kenzie freaked out and started crying and yelling, "Mommy, mommy, mommy," and grabbing on to me, not letting go. And then she said, "Let's go, go, go." She might have remembered being there from the last visit and getting a couple shots.</p>
<p>Then the doctor came in. I love her pediatrician, Dr. Midani. He is so good with her. This was the first time she cried with him. She usually is pretty good and corporative with him and lets him examine her. Not today. She cried and wiggled to grab on to me the whole time. Kept crying, "Mommy, mommy, mommy." I responded with, "It's OK, mommy is right here." Then she said, "Not OK!" That's when Dr. Midani laughed. He is always impressed with how intelligent she is.</p>
<p>She survived through this visit without getting a shot. Kenzie was supposed to get her Hepatitis A shot today, but since she had a fever, Dr. Midani wanted to wait until she was over her illness to be safe. So I'll have to take her back in two week to get the shot. Hopefully she'll be fine by then.</p>
<p>Kenzie is 32.25" tall (in the 50-75%) and weighs 21 pounds (5-10%).</p>

When I put her on there, she starts crying.</p>

So sad.		</p>

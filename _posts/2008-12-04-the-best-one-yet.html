<p>
				Couponing is a lot of work. For some people it's worth the time and trouble to save a few bucks. For others, it's not worth it. I have posted about my savings in shopping before (<a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/11/im-a-voter/">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/02/savings/">here</a>), but tonight, I have out done myself. It did take a lot of work.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/STibJ8R0afI/AAAAAAAADyo/Kg7e3kJCVMM/s1600-h/IMG_9416.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9416.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276137558566529522" /></a>
<div style="text-align: center;">About 1 1/2 hours of going through the ads and matching it with coupons.</div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>

<div style="text-align: center;">The stack of coupons I used, a total of 61 coupons. </div>
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>
<p><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/STibKC7pKdI/AAAAAAAADy4/00QYHe74qV4/s1600-h/IMG_9420.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9420.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5276137560352565714" /></a>
<div style="text-align: center;">I came home with 58 items and paid $49.84 for it all. I saved a total of $142.49 with store sales, store coupons, and manufacture's coupons. </div>
<p>Of course, I neglected my child by sticking her in front of the TV with toys, for the last bit while I finished up with the coupons. And then it was frustrating at the store when Kenzie decided to act up and mess around. Then the cash register girl had to go through and check every coupon, holding up the line. I eventually just asked her to put some of the items back because she was taking too long and I didn't have the time to wait for her to go through everything coupon by coupon. Well, at least I was able to stock up on crackers.		</p>

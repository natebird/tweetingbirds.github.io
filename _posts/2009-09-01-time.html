				Tiffany: We need to clean up our mess downstairs then it's bedtime.<br />Kenzie: OK, but then we can play princess for 5 minutes then get ready for bed.</p>

<p>Tiffany: Your 5 minutes are up, Kenzie. It's time to get ready for bed.<br />Kenzie: But 3 minutes just came down and I can play again because I'm 3.<br />Tiffany: [laughing] No, when Mommy says time's up that means your 5 minutes are over. <br />Kenzie: No they're not because the 3 minutes came down.		</p>

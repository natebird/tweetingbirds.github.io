				Going into March, let's see what the Birds have been up to the first two months of 2011…</p>
<p><strong><em>January…</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>2nd:</strong> Tiffany released as YW president while the Birds were in Kentucky visiting friends.</p>
<p><strong>9th:</strong> Nate called and sustained as the new YM president.</p>
<p><strong>16th: </strong>Tiffany called as a Primary worker teaching Valiant 8 class and as the Activity Days leader.</p>
<p><strong>28th:</strong> Laney turned 2. What a big girl.</p>
<p><strong>29th:</strong> Nate and Tiffany began painting the girls' room.</p>
<p><strong>31st:</strong> Tiffany went in for her first OB appointment. Saw the baby on the ultrasound and heard it's heartbeat. The family was there for the ultrasound and the girls discovered they will both be big sisters. At this point she was 10 weeks and 4 days along in the pregnancy according to the ultrasound.</p>

<p><strong><em>February…</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>1st: </strong>Tiffany's first time doing Activity Days with the Primary girls. That was definitely different than working with the YW. But all the girls seemed to be pretty good.</p>
<p><strong>5th: </strong>Attended Chinese New Year Festival. Oh, I guess I forgot to blog about that. Will do soon. We all had a great time eating authentic Chinese food. Oh.So.Good.</p>
<p><strong>8th: </strong>The Relief Society asked me to speak at their Enrichment about preparing for the temple. My talk was about preparing the youth for the temple. And I got my haircut right before Enrichment.</p>
<p><strong>14th:</strong> We were all sick with a head cold. So no Valentine's Day for us. We were all blowing our noses and coughing.</p>
<p><strong>15th:</strong> Took Kenzie to watch the Atlanta Ballet Company perform Sleeping Beauty. Then that evening I left for my business trip to Raleigh, N.C.</p>
<p><strong>16th:</strong> I worked in Raleigh shooting a video tutorial for a soon-to-be-released Samsung product with a few other blogger. First time spending the night away from the kids (other than when I was at the hospital giving birth to Laney). It was pretty nice.</p>
<p><strong>19th:</strong> Nate finished painting the girls' room. Just the painting part. Over 100 stripes and 25 layers of paint in that room. Wow.</p>
<p><strong>20th:</strong> Because we don't have enough church stuff going on, Nate and I were given the assignment from the Bishop to be the ward communication specialist for the cultural event for the Atlanta Temple Re-dedication.		</p>

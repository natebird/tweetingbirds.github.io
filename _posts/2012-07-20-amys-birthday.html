				Some of our good friends had a birthday party for their little girl who turned 1. These are our friends from when Nate's MBA program. He became friends with Amy's dad, Peter. We've gotten together a few times during their schooling and after. It has been a journey with them trying to get pregnant. So it was so exciting when they finally were blessing with Amy. She was born a couple months before Lai Lai.</p>
<p>I couldn't believe that Amy was turning 1. That meant Lai Lai will be 1 soon and I am not ready for that yet. Ugh. The party was fun. We met some of their other friends. And got to spend some time with cute Amy.</p>

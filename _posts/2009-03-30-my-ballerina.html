				<a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/11/halloween-2009/">Last Halloween</a> I made Kenzie a tutu with the intention that she was going to dress up as a fairy. But last minute changes were made when Kenzie spotted a <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/10/ward-trunk-or-treat/">Piglet costume</a> at the thrift store. Well, as I was going through her closet a few weeks ago, Kenzie spotted the tutu and wanted to wear it. She put it on, danced around the house saying, "I'm a ballerina." Cute.</p>
<p>Then a couple Sundays ago, after Nate helped Kenzie got dressed for church, Kenzie put on her tutu over her dress. She wanted to go to church in her tutu. Nate was reluctant, but my feelings about it was if she wanted to wear it, then let her wear it. As parents, you pick your battles and wearing a tutu to church wasn't worth fighting over. She received many complements from everyone at church which totally boosted her confidence. She twirled around for people and ran in circles showing off her ballet skills. Cuter.</p>
<p>Last Wednesday night, when it was Mommy's night, Kenzie wore her tutu again. This time I got pictures. She put it on over her pajamas. She danced around on her tippy toes. Then she did a somersault saying, "Ballerinas do that." Cutest.</p>

				Laney loves to tell knock knock jokes. Especially when I tell her "No, no," for something she is not supposed to be doing. She responds with, "Knock-knock," and proceeds to tell a joke. The knock-knock jokes usually are in jibberish ending with her laughing out loud. The other day she actually said one that made sense.</p>
<p>Laney: Knock-knock.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Who's there?</p>
<p>Laney: Eyes. [pointing to her eyes]</p>
<p>Tiffany: Eyes who?</p>
<p>Laney: Eye see you. Bahahaha.		</p>

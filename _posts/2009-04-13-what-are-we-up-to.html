<p>
				I seem to blog sporadically. Off for a week and playing catch up for the next week or two.</p>
<p>This is why I was off last week.</p>
<p><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Crocheted</span></b> flower clips for the girlies Easter outfit. <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Pulled weeds</span></b> by hand in our yard (it took three days). Took both cars in for <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">emissions tests</span></b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">,</span> one failed (readiness) and one passed. Oil changed in my car. Figuring out the <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">kids' insurance</span></b>, still working on this one.<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;"> </span><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Fixed the toilet</span></b> in our master bathroom. Tried to figure out why the <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">water dispenser</span></b> on our fridge is not working, still working on this one. Cleaned our leather couch, still trying to find time to treat it. Planned <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Kenzie's Easter surprise</span></b>. Went to a community <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Easter egg hunt</span></b>. <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Moved Laney</span></b> in the guest room. <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Moved a couch</span></b> into our bedroom. Allowed AARP waste 4 hours of my life with their <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">online drivers safety course</span></b>.  Worked on some <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">YW stuff</span></b>. Took Kenzie to a <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">puppet show</span></b>. Watched the <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">NCAA championship</span></b> until it got boring. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#33CC00;"><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#CC66CC;">Put away maternity clothes</span> </b></span>in the attic.</p>
<p>What I put off from last week and am now attempting to catch up on.</p>
<p>Read over <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">conference talks and YW broadcast</span></b>. Go through my <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">piled of magazines</span></b> that haven't read yet (over 10 magazines). <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">Vacuum</span></b>, our carpet desperately needs it. Vacuum and <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">wash the cars</span></b>. More <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">YW stuff</span></b>. Call about some <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">medical bills</span></b> from baby Laney. <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">Organize recipes</span></b>. Continue <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">spring cleaning</span></b>. Pay for registration of our cars. Think of something for <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">Nate's upcoming birthday</span></b>. Catch up on emails and <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">phone calls</span></b>. <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">Update blog</span></b>. And if I have time, <b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color:#FF6600;">crochet more hair clips</span></b>.</p>
<p>I'm still learning how to balance two kids, one husband, and a bazillion things on my to-do list. I don't know if I will ever get a hang of this. It was so much easier with just one kid. And Nate is ending spring semester next week. That means he'll be preoccupied with school stuff all this week and the next.		</p>

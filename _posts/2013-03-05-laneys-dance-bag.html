				This year with Kenzie doing ballet, tap, and jazz, and Laney doing ballet and tap, the dance bag they were sharing couldn't fit all their shoes, leotards and tights. So I made Laney a dance bag just for her. I designed it just for her, with sequins and a tutu. It's nice and big for her to fit everything she needs and more. She loves it. And I was also excited with how it turned out.</p>

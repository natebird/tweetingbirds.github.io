				Laney loves French fries. Nate was blowing on some fries to cool it off before giving them to Laney. Laney was eager to eat them. Her arms were flailing in the air and yelling at Nate to get her fries.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany:</b> Laney is just dying [for the fries]…<br /><b>Kenzie: </b>Mom, I don't want Laney to die because then I won't have a little sister anymore.</p>
<p>Later at that same meal setting…</p>
<p><b>Nate:</b> Laney, you are cute like your mommy.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> Laney is my little sister and she is going to die one day.		</p>

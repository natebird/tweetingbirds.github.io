<p>This past Monday we headed over to our friends, Greg and MaryAnna's house for family home evening. They used to be in our ward until the ward split. They have a gorgeous house that is decorated, every room, with beautiful Christmas decorations. The girls had a blast over at their house. We looked at the Christmas decorations, sang Christmas songs, the kids made a craft and had yummy treats. MaryAnna is so good with little kids. She does grandma camp in the summers for her grandchildren. And I love the grand piano in their home. The girls' loved playing with MaryAnna.</p>

<p>Then Greg showed the girls his huge Christmas village. That's his big thing at Christmas time. The girls oooh and ahh over that.</p>

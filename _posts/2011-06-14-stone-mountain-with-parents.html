<p>For Christmas we told my parents we would take them to Stone Mountain. Then we finally worked out a time to go in May. Our membership at Stone Mountain is ending, and although we would love to renew for next year, we don't think we would go as often with a new born baby. So this was pretty much our last hurrah at Stone Mountain. The girls had such a great time being at Stone Mountain with my parents. We even stayed for the laser show that evening. It was the perfect time to go because the weather was perfect and it wasn't packed with people. The girls are going to miss Stone Mountain next year. They say it's one of their favorite places.		</p>

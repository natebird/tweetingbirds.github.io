				We were able to attend the Chinese New Year Festival this year. Yay! OK, so this was at the beginning of February (the 5th to be exact). We missed it the last two years (the first one being I was in the hospital giving birth to Laney and last year the weather was bad). This year it was perfect. The food was delicious. Loved it all. The girls had a great time watching the dragon dance and feeding it red envelopes. And watching musical and dance performances by other Chinese children. Can't wait for next year!</p>

				This morning, I heard Kenzie say this little prayer in her bed through the baby monitor.</p>
<p>"Puo Puo. Maggie. Dudepa. Daddy working. Baby Bop. Night Night. AMEN!"</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Translation: </span><br />Bless…<br />Puo Puo- my mom.<br />Maggie- my mom's friend who came to visit a couple months ago from Taiwan.<br />Dudepa- my dad.<br />Daddy working- Nate at work.<br />Baby Bop- her Baby Bop doll she got from aunt Lorna and Marlane.<br />Night Night- her security blanket<br />AMEN!- she says amen like she's from the South. It's a drawn out AAAAA-Men full of attitude and emphasis.</p>
<p>I love it! She is usually pretty good about folding her arms, bowing her head, and telling people to "Shhh!" during prayer. However, I wasn't able to peek in on her to see if she was folding her arms during her own prayer.		</p>

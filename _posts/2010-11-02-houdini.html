				You know how we have lots of posts on our family blog with funny things Kenzie says? Well, I have a feeling that we'll begin to do lots of posts with shocking things Laney does. For exampleâ€¦</p>
<p>October 19,2010. We were driving home from my parents' house. We had just spent the evening with my dad with a fire pit dinner. On the way home while Nate was driving the car, all of a sudden I hear Laney's voice really close to my ear. Closer than it should have been. I turn around, and even though it was pitch black, I could see her standing below her car seat! What?! I had to do a double take. Nate had buckled her into her car seat before we left my dad's house. The seat belts were on there tight and the top buckle was up by her chest as where it should have been.</p>
<p>How did she get out?! We are still not quite sure except for the fact that she has been named and rightly titled <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/breaks-my-heart/" target="_blank">Little Houdini</a> since she was around 3 months old. She was having a grand ol' time back there getting up and down her car seat and looking out the back window. She loved that new found freedom. Being the worried mom, I had Nate pull over as soon as he could so we could buckle her in the seat again. I didn't want to end up on the 10 o'clock news.</p>
<p>Putting her back in her seat, I noticed that all the buckles were still in tacked. All except the bottom end of one of the shoulder straps had come loose. But still, she would have to get her head out from between the two shoulder straps and the top buckle at the chest. And then she would have to somehow magically get her other arm and leg out from the other side. This girl never cease to amaze me with the things she can do. She is incredible. She has that drive and that determination and she figures it out. I hope she keep that spirit in her. I will probably regret saying that when she turns teen, but it's a quality that I think we, adults, should have.</p>
<p>No pictures. It was complete darkness. Just imagine me with my jaws dropped and then laughing histerically as I discovered that all the buckles were still in place but the kid was out. And Nate shaking his head.		</p>

				I made these for the girls for Christmas. I wanted to make them something for Christmas but then I ended up sewing stuff for Kenzie's teacher at school and other things came up. So I ran out of time. These were quick and easy to make. I had it done just in time to put it in their stockings Christmas Eve. I love how adorable my model looks in these pictures.</p>

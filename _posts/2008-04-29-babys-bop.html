				As mentioned in the previous blog, Kenzie found this Baby Bop doll at Marlane and Lorna's house. She recognized Baby Bop from watching Barney. She attached herself to this doll right away and paid not attention to her Little Hello Kitty and Baby that I had brought or any of the other dolls at Lorna's house. Whenever we left the house, we had to bring Baby's Bop (that's what she called it). You'll see Baby Bop in many of our Utah pictures. She even slept with Baby Bop during naps and at night. The best part of Baby Bop was it sings the song, "Bumping Up and Down in My Little Red Wagon," when you give it a squeeze.</p>

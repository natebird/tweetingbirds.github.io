				Kenzie had these leg warmers from last winter. I had her start wearing to her dance classes over her tights to keep her legs warm. Plus I thought it would be a cute return to the 80s. I bought her a couple more pairs of leg warmers that she wears to dance classes. And now a few of the other girls in her class started wearing them to dance too. What a trend setter.</p>

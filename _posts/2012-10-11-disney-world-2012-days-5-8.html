<p>We just had the best time at Disney World with Nate's parents. We love being around them and the girls just love doing anything with them. And it was nice that we got to spend all day everyday for 8 days with them just having fun. Nothing else. No one had to cook or clean or work. It was so great. Our girls are already talking about the next Disney trip with Grandma and Grandpa Bird.</p>
<p>I made Disney shirts for all of us. It said "Dreams do come true with faith and gratitude" since that was Randy's motto with his cancer. On the back of the shirts had our last name and numbered off from 1-7.</p>
<p>It worked out to be a great week for Randy and Cyndi to be in Florida with us too since they were having crazy forest fires back home and everything was smoked in. Air quality was really bad. So they were excited to get away from that.</p>
<p>The girls did really well traveling as usual. Lai Lai would wake up and cry which is her normal sleep cycle and I usually just let her cry. But she was teething while we were there and I didn't want her waking up the other kids. So I would rock her back to sleep. But who needs sleep, right?! Especially moms. :)</p>
<p>Being there for that amount of time our girls were wore out by the end of the week. Laney slept for 3 hours on the way home. She never nap that long. She was so done on the last day. She still had fun but just wanted to go home. We made incredible memories there and had the time of our lives. It was nice to come home and get back to life again though.</p>
<p>Day 5 we were at Animal Kingdom. Spent the day there with the animals. We were rained out toward the end of the day at this park. But we had done most of what we wanted. And of course, we forgot the ponchos and the umbrellas in the van again. You would think we would be more prepared since we were rained out the day before. Nope. It was fun, part of the memory.</p>

<p>Day 6 we were at Magic Kingdom again. Since we didn't spend a lot of time at Magic Kingdom on day 4, we went back on day 6. There was still so much to do. This was the girls favorite park. And thanks to the fast pass, we didn't have to wait more than 15-20 minutes for any rides. We actually went back to the hotel and went swimming at the super fun pool.</p>
<p>The Friday before we left for Disney, Kenzie came home with the class stuffed animal that gets passed around to the kids. His name is TJ the traveling turtle. He had to hang with us all week and then Kenzie wrote in his journal what they did together. So yeah, he got a free ride to Disney.</p>

<p>Day 7 was more Magic Kingdom. Still didn't do everything so we went back for more fun. This was pretty much Randy and Cyndi's last day with us. Their flight was leaving early the next morning. Before we left the park, Grandpa and Grandma got the two older girls huge Mickey balloons they had been asking for but we didn't get them. They were so surprised and loved it. It was the perfect end. We had a nice last day with really great dinner that evening.</p>

<p>Day 8 finished off with even more Magic Kingdom. We just did the rides the kids wanted to do and then went home. We actually stayed longer than we had planned because there were stuff that the kids wanted to do before we left. So we got in the car around 3:30 and got home almost midnight.</p>

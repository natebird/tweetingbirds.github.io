<p>
				Kenzie keeps a laundry list of things that Daddy did… things that we have both forgotten, that happened months ago. She's not afraid to recite this laundry list to Nate whenever she needs to straighten out dad. Here's her list and she just added two new ones today. Explanations in {}.</p>
<p>Daddy, you…</p>
<ol>
<li>Scratched the floor. {In May we had the carpets cleaned. Nate tried to move the couch himself and ended up scratching the hardwood floor in the dining room.}</li>
<li>Jumped on my bed and broke it. {Back when Kenzie was about 2, Nate was sitting on her bed reading her a bedtime story and the board holding up the mattress on her bed fell.}</li>
<li>Ate my cheese. {Neither one of us remember this one}</li>
<li>Put away my paints. {She was painting the last Friday and I asked Nate to put the paints away when we had company over for dinner.}</li>
<li>And put the toilet seat in the wrong place. {Referring to her kid potty seat that usually sits on top of the regular seat.}</li>
</ol>

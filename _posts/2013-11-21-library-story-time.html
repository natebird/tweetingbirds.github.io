				I have been taking the younger girls to library story time every few weeks. The girls enjoy listening to the books but the best part is the parachute at the end. And they also like going around finding books to borrow. I love instilling the love of reading to my girls. We read stories every night and even Lai Lai loves to read stories together. Her favorite lately are Clifford books. </p>

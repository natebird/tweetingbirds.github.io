				I thought this would be something to start doing weekly. Last night, after Nate got home from school, we were talking about the events of the day. Somehow we started talking about his classmates in the MBA program. Some of them in their early 30's, married (probably not even half the student body) and of those who are married, a very small percentage of them with a child (typically a baby). Here's Nate: been married for 4 years with a toddler and a second one on the way and on the younger end of the spectrum in his MBA class.</p>
<p>Then Nate realized it was around this time five years ago when we first met. He remembered what I was wearing and even how I had my hair! I also remember vividly our first meetingâ€¦ flashback!</p>
<p>It was past midnight, "BYU's curfew," on a Sunday night and I was very involved in a game of Settlers of Catan, the Seafarers, with my guy buddies - Jeff, Braden, and Grant. It was probably our second or third game of the night. Some of us had a hard time losing. We were playing at the guy's horrible basement apartment, aka The Hole, in the Tree Streets. The Hole apartment will probably come up again in a later flashback. </p>
<p>I knew the guys from first meeting Jeff, who lived in the same apartment complex - Carriage Cove - and in the same singles ward as me. Through Jeff, I met Braden and Grant who were his high school friends. I spent most of that summer with the three guys. </p>
<p>Back to the night I met Nate, I was wearing a BYU sweatshirt and Adidas windbreakers pants. I had my hair pulled back in a ponytail. I had a rough week as my boyfriend and I were going through an on-again-off-again patch in our relationship. I think school had been in session for two weeks by this time. </p>
<p>Intensely into our Settlers game, in came the guy's first new roommate, Taylor. He had just spent the evening this his fiancee. Taylor walked in with a huge smile on his face, a little dazed, and with makeout  hair. The guys briefly introduced me. Taylor said hello, then headed back into his room. </p>
<p>Moments later, Nate walked in carrying a gallon size ziplock bag full of several decks of playing cards and quite a bit of dice. The guys joked about what Nate could have been doing with all those cards and dice. Nate explained how he was playing a game called Hand and Foot with his Wenatchee friends. Jeff introduced me to Nate and explained why I was still there after "curfew." Nate didn't care I was still there. He said "hey," then went back into his room that he shared with Taylor. </p>
<p>That was it. I do remember thinking at that first brief meeting that Nate is cute! I was taking a photojournalism class that semester, meaning I had my camera with me everywhere, and I snapped this picture of Nate in The Hole apartment a few weeks after our first meeting. I still didn't know him that well at the time of the photograph. But what a typical picture of Nate, he's talking on his cellphone that he used to have it clipped on his belt (what a dork!). Hehehe. :)</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Note from Nate:</span> I never clipped my phone to my belt. It was a small phone and I clipped it to my pants pocket with the phone on the inside - all you could see was the small clip. Just wanted to straighten out that part of the story. :-)</p>

				Last night, Kenzie and I attended our Home Owner's Association meeting to elect new members for the board. It was quite different than the last meeting about a year and half ago.</p>
<p>First of all, only about 10 homeowners attended the meeting. Nine of which had something to complain about and then there was me. And most of the complaints were just outrageously comical. The homeowners in attendance were the type that like to be intertwined in other people's personal businesses, calling the board members to put liens on their neighbor's house because they didn't mow the lawn for a month, and referred to the HOA covenants at the "Bible" and quoted from it off the top of their heads several times that evening.</p>
<p>Second, there was a point where there grown adults were going at it in a yelling match mainly complaining that there was a lack of communication between board members and the homeowners. But it took about 10 minutes of screaming 5-10 other frivolous complaints before they came to that conclusion. And what's a yell down without some cussing involved?! It wasn't heavy cussing, but there was a child in presence! I'm just glad that Kenzie didn't pick up on any of those words. The solution to lack of communication: a neighborhood newsletter and updates on our website.</p>
<p>Third, ridiculous suggestions were brought up to "better" the community. One lady suggested all of the homeowners to have the city cops phone number on speed dial because hooligans from another neighborhood have been coming over our gazebo area causing havoc. She said, "We need to call the police all the time so they know to patrol our neighborhood more." Right, having the police patrol our neighborhood is not going to make it look like there is something bad going on in our neighborhood all the time. And I'm sure the police doesn't have anything better to do than to drive around patrolling our quiet little neighborhood of about 67 homes. That's great use of our civic services and tax dollars.</p>
<p>Another suggestion was to purchase a glass cased bulletin board to be placed at the entrance of our neighborhood to post announcements and reminders so people can see as they drive in/out each day. If people don't show up to meetings it's because they have something better to do or just don't care. Placing a nice fancy glass cased bulletin board will just give something for the hooligans to vandalize and it'll look stupid at the entrance of our neighborhood. I think we can find something better to do with the money.</p>
<p>Last useless suggestion was to purchase a nice No Soliciting sign to be placed at the entrance of the neighborhood. When has a sign stopped anyone from placing stupid flyers on our mailboxes and knocking door to door to sell useless products? Maybe we should call the cops to come patrol for solicitors, too! The solicitors are much more hazardous than speeding cars on the roads. (Sarcasm)</p>
<p>Some good did come out of this meetingâ€¦ A suggestion was made to have a social committee to plan neighborhood activities to bring the community together. That sounded like a great idea since we live in a small neighborhood and it would be nice to get to know others. We also have quite a bit of children in the neighborhood and it would be fun to do something for the kids. I'm contemplating volunteering some of my time for that. But after seeing some of my neighbors at this meeting, I'm not sure I want to put myself out there to be yelled at because they are the kind of people that will always find something wrong in any situation.</p>
<p>Another thing was to change investigate how much it would cost and what the paperwork would be like to change the convent on the part of having three board members to five. I do think with the amount of people in the neighborhood complaining, we would need two more board members to handle all the heat.</p>
<p>And lastly, there was a suggestion to change part of the landscape on part of our entrance to save money. That was the best suggestion of all.		</p>

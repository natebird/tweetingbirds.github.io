<p>
				I signed the girls up for a 5-week dance class to keep them busy this summer. I also wanted to see how Laney does in a dance class since she's only 2 1/2 years old. Laney is in a 30-minute ballet class and Kenzie is in a 45-minute ballet and tap. Laney did wonderful in her first class. She was so good at following her teacher. There were 5 other little girls in the class. She was super excited to have her own class. Every morning she wakes up asking if she's going to ballet class. So it's good to know she likes the class. I'm thinking of having her continue the dance class in the fall when Kenzie starts kindergarten. It'll be something that she can look forward to while Kenzie is gone.</p>

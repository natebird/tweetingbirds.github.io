<p>October General Conference time always bring back memories for Nate and I as we celebrate our dating anniversary. We tend to make a bigger deal out of this than our wedding anniversary because we our dating story was a much better story than our engagement or wedding story. Everything was well and happy with the wedding. But the journey we both took to bring us together was a story that made us think that we were "Meant to be."</p>
<p>This year, as we reminisced the beginning of our dating days back in 2003, we realized the journey actually began at the beginning of time. So just sit back and endure a Reader's Digest version of our union.</p>
<p>It began with my mom getting a divorce and, later, remarrying when I was 7 years old, in Taipei, Taiwan. That brought my little brother and I and our new little family to Laie, Hawaii, shortly after her marriage. Then another across the globe move to Atlanta, Georgia, at the beginning of my high school career. Next, a mix up with my college applications that allowed me to be accepted to BYU-Provo rather than BYU-Hawaii (my # 1 choice at the time).</p>
<p>A reunion of my best friend, Julia, and me our freshmen year at BYU-Provo lead to us becoming roommates our sophomore year at Carriage Cove Apartments. That's where we met another good friend, Jeff, who lived in the same apartment complex and in the same ward. Through Jeff, I met his high school buddies Braden and Grant. These are the same guys in my previous flashbacks.</p>
<p>Nate was home the summer of 2003 working for his dad. Grant's older brother, Larry, was in Nate's parents' ward in Washington. At a Fourth of July ward activity, Nate was talking to Larry and had mentioned he was looking for a place to live when he goes back to Provo for fall semester. Larry told Nate that his brother, Grant and his friends were looking for a couple roommates for their new basement apartment in the Tree Streets in Provo.</p>
<p>Nate called up his friend, Taylor, to check out the apartment since Taylor was in Provo that summer. Attracted to the cheap rent, Taylor and Nate signed up to move in with Jeff, Braden, and Grant. And since I was such good friends with Jeff, Braden, and Grant, I would hang out at their apartment all the time, and that's when I met Nate.</p>
<p>We started hanging out a bit at the end of September, went on our first date Oct. 7, engaged by Dec. 14, and married by May 15. It has been a happily ever after since then.		</p>

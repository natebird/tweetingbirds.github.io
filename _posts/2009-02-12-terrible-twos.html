But recently, I'm not sure if it was set off by the new addition to the family or what, but Kenzie has skipped being 2 years old and went straight to a 4-year-old attitude. Partially because she speaks like a 4-year-old, the attitude must have just came along with the language skill.</p>
<p>Rather than throwing tantrums and crying on the floor, she is using logic and trickery to get what she wants. She does this mostly when we are trying to put her down for nap or bedtime. Kenzie tries to use the potty card 4-5 times as we are putting her to bed. Then she says she is hungry. Follow by I need a drink. Topping it off with, "Can you sing me one more song?" She does this after we read her a couple books. So bedtime ritual has become a 45 minute ordeal. Needless to say, we don't give her food at bedtime, hoping to also teach her to eat more at meal times. And we're setting the rule of you can only use the potty card twice. The rest we are quickly learning to say No often.</p>
<p>Kenzie is also wanting to do everything "By myself!" And if you don't let her, she gets all emotional and offended. She also wants attention given to her immediately when she asks for it. If you are in a middle of a conversation with someone, she'll come up to you, put her hand on your mouth and tell you to stop talking. Or she'll go up to you, put her hands on your face, turn your head towards her and say, "Look at me." And rather than tantrums, she folds her arms and pouts if she doesn't get what she wants. Then she tries to argue with you on why she should get it anyway using logical reasoning.</p>
<p>Nate did teach Kenzie a cleaver response to "Kenzie, are you a genius?" You'll have to ask her yourself.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SZSErED3pFI/AAAAAAAAEI4/WYhknsK9tqk/s1600-h/P1010932.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/P1010932.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5302008536681129042" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SZSErKY9tWI/AAAAAAAAEIw/5bXDQpqtE_E/s1600-h/P1020085.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 213px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/P1020085.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5302008538380219746" /></a>		</p>

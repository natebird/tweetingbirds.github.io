				Since <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2007/12/how-my-last-3-pairs-of-glasses-died/">Kenzie broke my glasses</a> a few months ago, I had to get new ones. I tried to fix it with tape, but it doesn't stay on my ear as well resulting in headaches. I went in for my glasses and contacts appointment last Monday while Cyndi and Randy were able to babysit. I went in wanting to get some cute plastic black frames, but since I only use my glasses as backup emergency glasses, I decided to go with a safer less fashionable glasses in case the black plastic ones go out of style in a few years. So this is what I ended up with.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R9WOnh1qJDI/AAAAAAAABlM/pEosYlkJrkw/s1600-h/IMG_7623.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7623.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5176200156481725490" /></a>		</p>

				While Kenzie is at school, Laney is home with me most days. She gets to pick out her movie to watch for the day (no arguing with Kenzie about whose turn it is to pick a movie) and have the toys all to herself. She plays as she pleases. No one telling her what to do or how to play. She's enjoying that quite a bit. She does miss Kenzie while she is at school, but she likes to do her own thing more. They play together after school. They love being together after school but they still do quite a bit of fighting and arguing when they are together.</p>

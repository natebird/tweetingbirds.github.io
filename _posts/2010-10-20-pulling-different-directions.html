<p>I just wanted to write this down so I can remember this later. It has been an adjustment with Nate working and completely finished with school. I love that he works regular hours and gets home at a decent time without having to do homework or study for exams. We have more flexibility to do stuff. But with Nate home more, I feel I get less done. I want to spend more time with him and the children when in the evenings. So I don't work on my projects or blogs. I feel like I am barely keeping my head above water. And sometimes my house just looks like the picture above when I need to get things done and I let the kids play with whatever they can get their hands on.</p>
<p>I am not complaining. I am just trying to figure out a way to do everything. I need to work on my time management and prioritizing. What can possibly be keeping me so busy all the time?</p>
<ul>
<li> <strong>Kids' &amp; husband's schedules.</strong> They are coming and going with friends and church. And it's a good thing. Nate gets called to help people move, give blessings and other stuff. Like the past two months he sat on the Board of Reviews for 2 of the YM's Eagle Scout meeting. He loved that. Some nights he has to work, but it's from home and usually after the kids are asleep. And once a month he does a game night (I call it geek night) with some of his guy friends. Kenzie has dance once a week. And they both have friends and birthday parties (two parties this week). I am glad they have a social life and good friends.</li>
<li><strong>My church calling.</strong> I had a teacher training meeting this past Sunday. I have a YW in Excellence tonight with dinner and program. With my calling, I get to put on 2 major parties every year. It's giving me lots of practice to be a party planner one day. My laurels were in charge of the activities this month. Along with the usual meetings before and after church. A constant thought on the YW in our ward and how I can better serve them. Working with the parents and other auxiliaries. There are weeks when I am at the church 3-4 times. I also do my best to do visiting teaching every months. The girls are so good about coming with me. I have 4 sisters on my list. They are all so wonderful ladies. I attend most of the YW events and also the RS events. That can be a lot of church sometimes. But I absolutely love working with the YW. They are amazing girls.</li>
<li><strong>Our first vacation.</strong> We are going on our first family vacation with just us. We will be going to Disney! I am so excited. We haven't told the girls yet. They will be way too excited about it. Since this is our first time going, there are a lot we are trying to learn about Disney. There are also some preparation involved to try to keep this trip as thrifty as possible. And getting work, blog, church all set up before we leave. I hope the weather is good.</li>
<li><strong>House projects.</strong> We are in the process of redecorating the house. It started out with just the painting. But then I realized that the previous decorations matched the new colors. We painted 4 rooms in 14.5 hours. It was insane. Stayed up late to finish up. But it looks great and the house is a lot brighter. The girls' room will be the next room we paint. It's going to be a hard one because I'm doing fancy stuff with it. I also hope to put both girls in the same room by the end of the year. However, with all that is on my plate, it's looking more like beginning of next year. While we are painting and stuff, the house is insanely messy, at least to me. I can't keep up with all the cleaning, especially with 2 girls who likes to play 52 pick up with several decks of cards. We also got a new ceiling fan that we need to put up. Nate just installed a garage door for his side.</li>
<li><strong>Seasonal organizing.</strong> Went through all of our clothes to check what we had for winter. Nothing. Laney was the only person with clothes - hand-me-downs from Kenzie. So I have been shopping. Online and in stores. Kenzie is hard to shop clothes for because she is way too skinny and tall. None of the pants fit her. I need to find a way to keep her pants on. Since we are still a little in between seasons right now. I can't exactly put away all the summer stuff. Especially with Disney coming up.</li>
<li><strong>Simply Modern Mom.</strong> My blog is keeping me really busy. I am working with Dell computers in promoting Breast Cancer Awareness this month. I am doing a partnership with BEHR paints who provided all the paints for our house projects. I am trying to set up some giveaways for a giveaway event at the end of November. I have companies and people emailing all the time about doing reviews and promotions for their products. I am so behind on my email. I owe about 40 people email responses. And I am trying to schedule posts for the week that we're gone on vacation. I am also guest posting on other blogs. The tricky thing is all the crafts I do. I have to do the craft, take pictures, edit photos, write the tutorial, edit and promote it. The site is still growing, but it is growing a little slower than it was when I was working full force on it. Now that Nate is home more, I spend more time with my family than on my blog.</li>
<li><strong>Tweeting Birds.</strong> Yes, this blog. It takes time to write and post pictures. But it's so important to me to keep track of this stuff for our family history.</li>
<li><strong>Christmas sales.</strong> I am stocking up on Christmas gifts already. I hate doing last minute Christmas shopping. And I buy stuff now that are on clearance and save it for Christmas. I know, I can be a little too organized sometimes.</li>
<li><strong>Friends.</strong> We have been getting together with friends. We have the greatest friends. They are all so wonderful so we like to get together with them as often as possible.</li>
<li><strong>Family.</strong> My mom is gone for 6 weeks to Taiwan to visit her family. My dad is all alone. So we try to feed him once a week. We also have quite a few family events since we live so close to family. My brother, I help him out every once in a while. But he also helps us too, like with painting and babysitting. That's what family is for right? We are so blessed to live near family and to have such a great family.</li>
<li><strong>Creating family memories.</strong> We have been trying to do more outdoor things lately. We are attempting to be a more physically active family. We go to parks and pumpkin patch and art festivals and farmer's markets. I think they are all great experiences for the children even at their young age.</li>
<li><strong>Attempting to be a morning person.</strong> I am so not a morning person. But I have been trying to get up at 6:30 every morning to answer emails and blog before the girls wake up. The problem is Kenzie is up at 7 a.m. on the dot. And I try to go to sleep early at night, but it usually ends up being 11 or so. It is totally not working for me. I am the type of person who needs 8-9 hours of sleep. Sigh. I don't know how Nate does it. He is out the door by 6 a.m.</li>
<li><strong>Craft projects.</strong> I have so many things I want to make for the house since we are redecorating. And I just have all these craft projects for the holidays too. I'm picking up sewing again after a few months of hiatus.</li>
<li><strong>Cleaning the house.</strong> It's impossible to have the entire house clean at the same time. I would have to hire help for that to ever happen. I sweep the dining room 3 times a day, after each meal. Pick up toys and stuff throughout the house anytime I walk into a new room.</li>
<li><strong>Running errands.</strong> Getting stuff for YW, shopping for winter clothes, returning things, finding decorations for the home, family stuff, going to the library, etc. The only thing that keeps the girls happy while I tug them with me everywhere is food - good snacks.</li>
</ul>

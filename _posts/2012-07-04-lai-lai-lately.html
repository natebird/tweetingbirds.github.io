<ul>
<li>She is walking everywhere. I love seeing those chubby legs wobble around the house.</li>
<li>Is eating finger foods. Loves blueberries, squash, bread, noodles, carrots, zucchini, chicken.</li>
<li>Puts everything in her mouth. Just this week she tried to swallow marbles that Laney had left on the floor. I had to get her to cough it out. Scared me to death.</li>
<li>Is a happy baby when being held by mom.</li>
<li>She loves her sisters. She is quite entertained by them. Wants to do everything they are doing.</li>
<li>Wants to play with her sisters' stuff and they are not too fond of that.</li>
<li>Is getting better being left at the child care at the gym while I work out. She actually plays and doesn't cry the whole time anymore.</li>
<li>Doesn't like to ride the in car seat. But once the car gets going she is fine.</li>
<li>Is sleeping through the night from 7:30 p.m. to 7 a.m. She took the longest to get sleeping 12 hours because I wasn't too strict on her since during the school year I had to wake up around 5:30 to get things ready for the day and school. So she used to wake up around that time wanting to nurse. But summer came around I decided I wanted to sleep in so I cut out that early morning feeding and she has been doing just fine.</li>
<li>Naps about 2-3 naps a day. Sometimes just one when we are running everywhere.</li>
<li>Is very curious and I can already tell has a mischievous side to her.</li>
<li>Has similar personality as Laney.</li>
</ul>

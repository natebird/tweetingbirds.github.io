<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Meet Julia (left), BFF since fourth grade. Meet Natalie (middle), BFF since second grade. We were best friends at Laie Elementary. Then Natalie moved in 5th grade and Julia in 6th. We lost touch with Natalie over the years. But Julia and I kept in touch through letters, before the days of emails and free long distance calls.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Fate had the three of us all end up at BYU. Julia and I were expecting each other there. Then Natalie, she found me on BYU's directory. We've been keeping in touch since then. Julia and I were roommates in college. </div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Then Nate and I started dating. He was working at the computer labs on campus and talking to his coworkers, one of whom was Natalie. Natalie was preparing to go on a mission at the time. When she got her call, Nate and I attended her farewell open house. Small world, she knew the both of us from different times and places. </div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size: small;">Natalie and Thayne</span></div>
<p>Julia got married nine months before me. I got married while Natalie was still on her mission to Korea. When Natalie got back from her mission, she dated Thayne. Then married him. Now we all have children and living all over the map of the U.S. We still keep in touch.		</p>

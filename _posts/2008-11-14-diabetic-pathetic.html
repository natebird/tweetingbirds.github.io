My first concern wasn't so much how it will affect the baby or me. Rather, my first concern was about the self inflicted needle poking I will be doing with the monitor, lancets, and test strips. I know, I'm pathetic and probably a horrible person for not thinking of how it will affect the baby first. I just have this thing with needles.</p>
<p>I'll attend a class next Wednesday that will teach me everything I need to know about putting myself on a special diet, doing daily (four times a day) glucose tests with the monitor, so on and so forth. I'm sure this will affect my life in more than one way.</p>
<p>Reading more about gestational diabetes, I learned that it occurs to about 10% of pregnant women, usually heavy set or obese (humm… I don't think I'm obese), usually older in age (humm… I don't think I'm THAT old being 25), or it can be genetic (that must be it, at least I hope). This type of diabetes is the easiest to control and usually goes away after delivery of the infant. However, that does increase my chance of having diabetes later in life. That I was expecting already since my mom says diabetes run in her side of the family.</p>
<p>It won't affect the baby much as long as I control my glucose level on a daily basis, hence the monitor and needle poking. And it also brings awareness to myself and my OB that I have a good chance for a big, jaundice baby, also meaning a chance of long labor. This way my doctors will know to watch for that and have the necessary equipment to take care of the jaundice baby after delivery.</p>
<p>Thinking back on it, I think I may have had gestational diabetes when I was pregnant with Kenzie even though I tested negative for it at my glucose test. She came big (9 lb 2 oz) and had high levels of jaundice shortly after birth. I also had a long delivery with her (3 hours) using a vacuum to get her out.</p>
<p>Now that I know I am gestational diabetic, I know I will also be diabetic in future pregnancies. If I have to poke myself with needles all the time with future pregnancies, I think having two kids will be enough for me. (I am only half-way kidding here.)		</p>

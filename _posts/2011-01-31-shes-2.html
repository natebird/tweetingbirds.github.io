<p>Although she was never a baby, I'm still sad that she's growing up on me. This girl grew up way too fast. Sometimes I think she is older than 2 because she's been doing everything on her own for so long. Last Friday was her birthday and that morning we called Nate at work…</p>
<p>Nate: Laney, is today your birthday? Are you 2?</p>
<p>Laney: No, 5.</p>
<p>Kenzie: No, she's not 5! She's 2!</p>
<p>And later, Laney and I had this conversation…</p>
<p>Tiffany: What would you like for breakfast, Laney?</p>
<p>Laney: Cheese. [Her usual answer.]</p>
<p>Tiffany: Cheese, huh.</p>
<p>Laney: Frosting. Cake!</p>
<p>Um, yeah. I think she knew it was her birthday. Still. No cake for breakfast. We had oatmeal instead. And luckily it was a beautiful sunny day so we were able to go out in the backyard to play for a bit. This girl. She's a mommy's girl. All the way. I love it even though it means she is hanging on me all the time and has to keep me in sight all the time. But I cherish it because I know it won't be like that when she's a teenager.</p>

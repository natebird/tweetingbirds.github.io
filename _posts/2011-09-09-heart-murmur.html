<p>While we were in the hospital one of the nurses heard a heart murmur in Lai Lai. At first they thought it was her heart trying to close the holes from birth. And when we left the hospital, the nurses and the pediatrician said they didn't hear it any more. But when we went to her two day wellness check, the pediatrician heard it again. So he sent us to the hospital to have an echo/ultrasound done to see what was causing that murmur. He also sent us to get her bilirubin checked because he thought she looked a little yellow. We were sent to the lab and the hospital right away because it was a Friday and the pediatrician wanted to results back before the weekend.</p>
<p>On the way to the hospital I called my mom to see if she could pick up Kenzie from school. We went straight from the doctor's office to the lab to the hospital and was gone pretty much all day running around. Laney was so good even though she missed snack, lunch and nap time. We grabbed some lunch on the way to the hospital and ate it there.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon her pediatrician called and said it wasn't an emergency, but she does have a heart murmur. We would need to meet with the cardiologist that following week. We went in that following Wednesday to meet with her pediatric cardiologist. He was the one who looked at her echo results and Lai Laihas a pulmonary heart stenosis. Her pulmonary valve is thicker than normal. For now, it's fine. They want to keep at watch on it to see how it develops as she grows. If it thickens more then they would need to do a procedure to open up the valve more using a catheter and balloon. Until then she is normal and fine to do what any other children are doing.</p>

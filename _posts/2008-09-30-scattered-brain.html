				That describes me lately. Also the word spacey. This whole pregnancy thing is kicking in and I have moments when my mind blanks and I forget the most obvious things - people's names, why I walked into a room, where I put something, what day it is, and so forth.</p>
<p>Put that symptom on top of a busy forth coming month of Young Women - 4 mutual nights, 1 joint activity, 4 meetings I attend, 1 stake dance, 1 youth temple trip, 1 service auction in conjunction with the ward trunk-or-treat, 2-3 stake musical practices, and YW in Excellence just a month away. It's a lot of work and it keeps me busy all the time. It's good because it keeps my mind off Nate's absence.</p>
<p>Then add on the day-to-day stuff with some family stuff and Nate being away part and who knows what else is going on in my head. It results inâ€¦ a scattered brain. And for someone who needs things to be orderly (a slight OCD there), I'm having a hard time dealing with the scattered portion of it all. Therefore, I'm working on getting thing organized so I can feel more complete. Sad isn't it?</p>
<p>P.S. I love <a href="http://www.cozi.com/">this site</a> for family calendar. I use it mostly to keep a family journal of our day-to-day stuff. It also has a feature for you to write a family journal. Other features include shopping list, email notes, family calendar color coded, and uploading pictures.		</p>

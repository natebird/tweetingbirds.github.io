<p>Kenzie turned 5 last week! This year I decided not to do a party. It was too crazy with us getting her ready for school, starting school and her birthday being the second week of school. And the baby arriving in about a week. We have been trying to get things ready for the baby. Plus I haven't thrown Laney a big birthday party yet and I feel bad that Kenzie has been the one getting all the birthday parties. So maybe next year will be the year of parties.</p>
<p>We did celebrate her birthday with <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/08/museum-birthday-celebration/" target="_blank">taking her to the museum</a> the Saturday before her birthday. She loved it and wants to go back every Saturday. Then I made cake pops to give out to her class the day of her birthday. This was my first time making cake pops so I decided to go simple. And Nate helped me put up some streamers and balloons in the house so she can be surprised in the morning.</p>

<p>She was pretty excited about turning 5. She told some of her friends at school the day prior to her birthday that her birthday was going to be the next day. She had gotten a little runny nose and coughing on Sunday prior to her birthday. No fever, but whenever she gets even a small stuffy nose and coughing she wheezes. It's asthma related. So we were giving her inhaler throughout that week of her birthday. Luckily she felt fine, just needed some help with wheezing.</p>

<p>The day of her birthday I brought some cake pops I made to her class as a treat for everyone. Her teacher gave her a star crown to wear and she wore it all day long. She was happy that everyone, wherever we went said happy birthday to her. Her class sang to her and had the cake pops at lunch. She loved the decorations Nate put up and wanted me to leave it up for a while. That night I made her favorite meal for dinner - breakfast for dinner, particularly crepes. Kenzie requested peach pie so we stuck candles on them and sang happy birthday to her. I didn't attempt to make a peach pie this time of year. Plus I just didn't have time. We opened presents and the girls played with them for a while before bed time.Â She said she had a great day and that was what mattered.</p>

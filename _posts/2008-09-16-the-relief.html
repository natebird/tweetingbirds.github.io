				I had another checkup today with my OB. Everything went well and the baby sounded good. It's weighing at about 13 oz with the due date still set at Jan. 30. Kenzie and Nate met me at the doctor's office for the sonogram. The technician asked Kenzie if she wanted a baby sister or brother. She responded with "baby brother." Unfortunate for her, Nate and I have been hoping for another girlâ€¦ and we got our wish. Now if we can just come up with a name - that's the hard part. Anyone out there with a good girl name we can steal?</p>

She is an active one kicking and moving around a lot. But she let us have a good look at her today. Kenzie also had fun listening to the baby's heartbeat.		</p>

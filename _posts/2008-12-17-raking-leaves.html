				We actually didn't have to do too much raking as we have a small yard. Also, each year, the wind somehow magically blows majority of the leaves into two neat little piles in our backyard. It has done it every winter we have been in our house. At first I thought someone came into our yard to rake it into two piles. But later, we realized it was not a kind neighbor but rather the wind. Either way, it's nice!</p>
<p>Last Saturday, when we decided it was finally time to get rid of the leaves, we took Kenzie out with us. I was mostly waiting for Nate to finish up with school so he could help me with this task. In preparation, Kenzie got out her little shovel and rake and did her best to help mom and dad. Since there wasn't much raking to do, we mostly gathered the leaves in a bin for Nate to run it up the hill and into the woods in our backyard.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUctfhwbGYI/AAAAAAAAD1A/0PP4YIjcytQ/s1600-h/IMG_9451.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9451.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280239107775863170" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUctfmCqFKI/AAAAAAAAD04/MNzNgQiVWQU/s1600-h/IMG_9445.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9445.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280239108926084258" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SUctfa_3voI/AAAAAAAAD0w/5v6N96TkViM/s1600-h/IMG_9449.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9449.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5280239105961606786" /></a>		</p>

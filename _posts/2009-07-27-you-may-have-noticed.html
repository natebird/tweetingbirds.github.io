				Perhaps my photos have improved slightly with a noted copyrighted mark at the bottom. That is because I got a new camera. Our old one is quickly dying on us as we have dropped it one too many times. Plus the photo quality wasn't as great. We were using the camera that Nate purchased before I knew him, over 6 years ago. As I have been researching DSLR cameras, I found an awesome deal on a Canon Rebel. The deal is still going until the end of September if you are interested in a DSLR camera.

<div>Then it took a long while to figure out how to post higher quality pictures onto Blogger without having it look too pixilated. I have been uploading it up to Picasa for Blogger and Flickr for WordPress (for SMM blog). Flickr for WordPress works great in keeping the quality of the photo. But Picasa to Blogger is still pixilating the photos. I'm glad I have a husband who knows his stuff when it comes to technology, web design, and computers. And he is willing to help me when he has time.

<div>Also, I am trying to establish myself more in the blogging world with my public craft blog <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com">Simply Modern Mom</a>. There are still a lot of things I need to work on to market my SMM blog more. I guess a word of mouth/blog would help *hint, hint*. </div>

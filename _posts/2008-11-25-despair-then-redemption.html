<p>
				The day began roughly with potty training. Kenzie just wasn't into it and thought it was a game we were playing. She totally messed with me most of the day having accidents in her pants and thinking it was funny. She would act like she felt bad, but when we were practicing (from the "Toilet Training in Less Than a Day" book), she would play around. I made her clean up the messes and change her own pants, she actually enjoyed it. She didn't like the wet pants, but that wasn't incentive enough for her to not wet it. I would talk to her about the difference between going in her panties and going to the toilet, and she got all that. It just didn't seem like it was working at all. She had three accidents in a row by 1:30 p.m.! <span style="font-weight:bold;">Despair</span> settled in my mind. I wanted to quit this attempt and wait until she turns 16 when she toilet trains herself.</p>
<p>I put her down for a nap at 2 p.m. mainly for me to get a breather and release some frustration and stress. While she was down, I Googled, "toddler peeing in pants for attention." Results came up of discussion forums with moms complaining about the same thing, but their children where around ages 4 and 5. Reading the discussions, I came to a new train of thought. I decided I was going to try more positive reenforcement, stop the threats, and not make a huge ordeal out of wet panties. Other people suggested rewards and treats, but I'm not an advocate of giving my child candy or food treats as rewards. I would rather give her praise, love, and other type of rewards like a trip to the museum or Puo Puo's house or a toy.</p>
<p>After nap time was round two of potty trainingâ€¦ I had a new tactic.</p>

She would play with the toilet lid and other parts. I also taped a picture of her favorite Super Why character on the wall next to her toilet as a source of encouragement. I would say, "Super Why is waiting for you to pee pee in the toilet," or "Let's go show Super Why how you can pee pee in the toilet."</p>

When she had accidents, we drew sad faces. When she had success in the toilet, she had the privilege of picking a happy face sticker and put it on the chart.</p>

That seemed to work, too.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Redemption:</span> Kenzie didn't have any accidents after the nap. Instead, she had two successful trips to the toilet. One time she actually came up to me and said, "Mommy, I need to go pee pee in the toilet." That made me so happy! We called my mom and brother to have them congratulate her on her achievement. My mom also helped entice her with all the toys and fun they would have at her house if she doesn't have anymore accidents. We'll see how tomorrow goes.		</p>

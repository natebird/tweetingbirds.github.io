<p>This girl is going to break some hearts when she gets older. She came out of quiet time dressed like this. She hopped in the car, heels and all, to pick up Kenzie from school like this. She's quite the diva. But that's what I love about her. She is herself and that is someone who loves to dress up and be fancy. Nothing short of a princess.</p>

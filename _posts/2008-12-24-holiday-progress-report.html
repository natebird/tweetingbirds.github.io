<blockquote></blockquote>
<p>The year is coming to an end and rather than setting resolutions for the new year at the moment, I would I to reflect on how we are doing currently in our household.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 51, 51);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Nate: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>Is in the middle of his three-week break from school. He did amazing for his first semester, achieving A's and B's. He will start school again Jan. 5, with a tougher schedule.</li>
<li>Still technically unemployed, he has been a slave driver to his new "boss", himself. Over the break, he has been working long hours trying to finish up the website for his first client. And the poor guy is sick right now with a head cold.</li>
<li>All he asked for Christmas from Santa this year was consistency of paychecks coming in, hopefully soon. </li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Tiffany: </span></span>
<ul>
<li>I have been getting into the holiday baking and treat making spirit. Probably because I have been craving sweets. Probably not good for my diabetes. But it does wonders for my taste buds.</li>
<li>My belly is slightly larger than Santa Clause's. It is making it harder for me to get up and down and move all around, something necessary when I am home with a toddler all day.</li>
<li>All I asked for from Santa this year was a day off from being mommy and spend the time on unfinished projects or just spend it with some good friends.</li>
</ul>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style=""><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 102, 204);">Kenzie:</span></span></span>
<ul>
<li>Completely potty trained for over a week now, even through naps and through the nights. Hurray! The only thing is she still needs our help with getting on the toilet since we have her on the regular adult toilets but no step stools to assist her with the height. And at church, she has figured out that saying, "I need to go to the bathroom," will get her out of sacrament meetings.</li>
<li>She has developed and grown the most of all of us. She has quite the imagination when it comes to playing with toys and her princesses. She talks like a 4-year-old, the same communication level and sassy attitude. She can read the alphabet, both upper and lower case letters, and is working on reading her numbers. She loves to "spell" out words, meaning she calls out random letters and says what it spells. She loves to recite nursery rhymes and sing songs - even Christmas songs, "Jingle Bells" and "We Wish You a Merry Christmas."</li>
<li>All she asked for this Christmas from Santa was a big candy cane.</li>
</ul>

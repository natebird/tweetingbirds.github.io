				Nate in attempt to get the girls to clean up all their toys decided to introduced Kenzie and Laney to the Gunny Bag. It was something that Nate's parents did with him and his siblings when they were little to get them to clean up. The gist of it is if they don't clean up, the Gunny Bag (a large trash bag) will pick up their toys and hold it ransom for a week. It worked great on little Nate. But didn't work well on our girls. Daddy discipline backfired on him. He didn't take into consideration the following points considering our girlsâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li>Kenzie is great at cleaning up toys. All you have to do is ask her. She's an obedient child and usually doesn't need any convincing.</li>
<li>Laney doesn't care much for cleaning and she's the one who probably needed the Gunny Bag the most. But it didn't influence her at all.</li>
<li>Kenzie got all emotional and worried that her toys were going to be taken by the Gunny Bag. It got to the point where she started panicking and crying profusely. No matter what we said she couldn't stop crying.</li>
<li>Kenzie and Laney started fighting because Kenzie was trying to pick up while Laney was still playing. They got mad at each other thanks to the Gunny Bag. It caused even more yelling and crying, this time from both girls.</li>
<li>Kenzie doesn't take threats very well. She is not one who needs to be threatened to get her to do things. All you have to do is reason with her. Laney is the one who you needs to know the consequences to get her to do stuff.</li>
<li>Kenzie remembers everything and this has already traumatized her for the rest of her life. He'll be paying for her counseling when she is a teenager. And she'll bring this up every time she wants something from dad. "Remember that time you threatened me with the Gunny Bag, Dad?"</li>
<li>Even the next day at cleaning up time she was still panicky and teary eyed even when we didn't mention the Gunny Bag.</li>
</ul>
<p>When Nate disciplines, I usually support him. But this time, I had to make sure he talked to Kenzie about how the Gunny Bag was made up and not going to take away her toys. Laney, on the other hand, we'll need to figure something out even worst than Gunny Bag to get her to clean up.		</p>

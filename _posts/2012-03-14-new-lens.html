<p>I got my new lens! I've literally have been saving for it penny by penny for the past 2 years. It's a hefty one and so cool! This is going to help with taking pictures of the kids in the house where there's low natural light since it has a fix aperture of f/2.8! Now I just have one more lens to purchase (which is not quite as expensive as this one but still really expensive), the 24-105mm zoom lens. Then maybe I'll upgrade my camera body after that. That's still years away from happening since it took me 2 years to save for this one. At this rate my camera bag won't be complete until 2016. And then I'm sure I'll have to get a new camera bag too. Hehehe. For now I'm going to love this lens wholeheartedly.		</p>

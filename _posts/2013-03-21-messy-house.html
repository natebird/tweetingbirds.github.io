				I have a lot going on and I take on a lot of projects. Often my house looks like this. One of the reasons why we need a bigger house. We need a playroom where all the toys go with a door that can keep the toys in the room. And we also need a painter who can paint over the drawings Laney likes to do on the wall with pencils. Yeah, that's flat paint. So we can't get that out without taking the paint off. This year, I did come to the decision to blog a little less on Simply Modern Mom. Rather than writing posts 5 days a week, I am just doing 2-3 a week. It will free up time for me to get more things done. And I feel like once I get caught up on all these past posts on here, I can start fresh! Almost there!</p>

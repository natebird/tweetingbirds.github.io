				Hanging around outside while they wait for Kenzie during piano lesson.</p>

<p>Putting away winter clothes and getting out summer clothes for four girls took several weeks. Partly because it kept getting cold after a few days of hot days.</p>

<p>This little girl is tired out on some days. And she puts her clothes on by herself so sometimes it's on backwards and she insists it's correct.</p>

<p>Shopping with three kids look like this, as we wait for Kenzie during dance class. We don't get much.</p>

<p>Kenzie had a word on her spelling list that I didn't know what it was. Gneiss?</p>

<p>Nora has curls on the side of her head. None of my other kids had that. So cute.</p>

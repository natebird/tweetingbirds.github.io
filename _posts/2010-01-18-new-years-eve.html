				We stayed in on New Year's Eve. It was nice to just hang out with the family. Especially since Laney was still not feeling well by then. I took her into the doctor first thing Monday morning (after Christmas) and she had pink eyes, ruptured ear drum in the left ear that also had an infect and strep. She also had a low fever. New Year's Eve was day three of her antibiotics and eye drops.</p>
<p>Then once we got the kids to bed, Nate and I had our <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2010/01/project-52-new-years-eve-date/">first date night</a> for our <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2009/12/project-52-date-nights/">Project 52: Date Nights</a>. We committed to having date nights once a week in 2010. We are also encouraging everyone to join us in our Project 52: Date Nights. It has been fun doing it and we have been <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/category/project-52/">blogging about each date</a> on my Simply Modern Mom website. I have been getting such great responses from my followers on SMM about Project 52: Date Nights.</p>

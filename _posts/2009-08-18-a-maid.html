				At the dining room table.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, I need to find a clean chair.<br />Tiffany: You chair is clean. I cleaned it after lunch, remember?<br />Kenzie: [looking at her chair] Oh, yeah. But the table is dirty.<br />Tiffany: Who made the mess?<br />Kenzie: I did.<br />Tiffany: Then who should clean it up?<br />Kenzie: [answers a bit too quickly] You, mom.<br />Tiffany: What?!<br />Kenzie: I mean us. You and me.		</p>

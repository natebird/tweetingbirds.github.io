<p>
				A lot of firsts this year. I have a 1st grader! So excited for her. She was ready for school to start again. We went to her school open house. Nate was not able to make it so I had all three girls with me. I didn't even bring my camera because I knew that wasn't going to work. So I just snapped some quick pictures with my phone. I was anxious to see which teacher she got for first grade. You always hope they get a good teacher. Kenzie got Mrs. Wilson who, from everything I've heard, is amazing. She was the teacher of the year last year. She seemed super nice and one of those teachers who just loves her job.</p>
<p>Kenzie's class seemed pretty good too. There was one kid from her kindergarten class in her class this year. And she knew a couple other girls from last year's reading group or car riders. And one of her friends from church and dance is in her class this year. She was excited about that. I was a bit bummed that none of her good Â girlfriends from last year was in her class this year. But she has recess with a couple of her good girlfriends. So at least they get to play together then.</p>
<p>Although, since we have been back to school, the girls (all 3 of them) have been waking up around 6 a.m. That's even before my alarm goes off! (My alarm is set for 6:03 a.m.). Booooo! I hope it's just the excite of school starting and that they start sleeping in more. All of us have been trying to adjust to school schedule again. The hardest part is figuring out Lai Lai's nap times.</p>
<p>The first week went well. She loves school. I went in the second day of school to help her teacher sort out all the school supplies. Got to see how she runs the class and talk to her more. I signed up to be a room mom again this year, but two other moms did too. So I'm thinking of maybe letting them do it. I think 3 rooms moms is a lot and can get confusing. We'll see.</p>
<p>I drove Kenzie to school the first day of school (well, actually every day, still a car rider this year). The traffic to school was crazy. We left around 7:05 and parked at 7:45. Lots of parents driving their kids to school, especially the kindergarteners. I had to help carry school supplies in because there were so much no way she could have taken them in herself. And once again, I was on my own with all 3 kids in tow. Not too bad though, thanks to the stroller! But the traffic wasn't as bad as the afternoon pick up traffic. I sat waiting in the car rider line for 1 hour and 5 minutes!! Ridiculous. It was the first day and they had to make sure all the kids (especially the kindergartners) get home the correct way. And there were lots of parents driving that first day of school. And the new parents didn't know the pick up routine so they held the line up longer. Phew. I was glad to make it out of there without running out of gas.</p>
<p>That evening, to celebrate first day of school, we took the kids to Chick-Fil-A for dinner. And we were also supporting Chick-Fil-A appreciation day for the owner coming out to say he believed that marriage is between man and woman. He got a lot of negative comments and publicity for that. The line at all the Chick-Fil-As all day were crazy. We knew dinner would be the worst. But everyone were glad to stand in line to support such a great cause. We were in the drive-through line that was wrapped around the building twice.</p>
<p>All in all. It was a great day!</p>

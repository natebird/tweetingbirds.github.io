				Slowly but surely I have been upgrading my camera equipments. It has been awesome. I got a new lens right before our trip out to San Francisco for Nicole's wedding. I'm a believer that it's best to invest in camera lenses because you just buy them once and it's interchangeable with the camera (as long as you stay with the same brand). Camera bodies you can always upgrade those at a pretty decent price, especially if you sell the old body. But lenses makes a huge difference with what you are able to do with aperture and shutter speed and the quality of the photos. And believe me, we quickly got insurance on the lens just in case anything happened to it.</p>
<p>This lens is great for photographing children. The aperture goes to f/2.8! That's awesome.</p>

<p>Then for my birthday Nate got me the <a href="http://luma-labs.com/products/cinch" target="_blank">cinch camera strap</a> that has helped so much in the way I carry my camera. I feel a lot safer now with how I carry my camera on my shoulders. Lucky me.</p>

<p>Then just a few weeks ago I got another lens. I know. I'm so spoiled. This is the last lens I'm going to get. It's really all I need. This one is great for traveling and events. This is a wide angle and has a little better zoom than the other one I got. And the aperture goes to f/4! Not too shabby. I wasn't planning on getting this lens so soon after I got the other lens. But it was on sale for really cheap. I mean REALLY cheap. So I had to grab it at such a great deal. I won't be getting anything for my camera for a while. But next thing on my list would be a new camera bag that has room for my laptop too. And one day I will upgrade the camera body. That will be way in the distant future though. I'm so excited about my new lenses and camera strap!</p>

I absolutely love Greek food and their culture. I desire to go to Greece one day. Since it was a last minute spontaneous trip, we brought the kiddos along. We didn't stay long enough in my opinion because I wanted to check out some of their displays and watch the performances. But neither one of the kids had naps that day and Laney was hungry. That's life with two kids. </p>
<p>We still had a great time and will definitely go back next year.		</p>

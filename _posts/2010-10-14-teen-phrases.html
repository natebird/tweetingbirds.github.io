<p>
				Kenzie has an attitude and speaks like a 13-year-old. I am not looking forward to the teenage years when this is just going to get worst. At 4 years she saysâ€¦</p>
<p>"It's not fair!"</p>
<p>"Mom, how about you clean it up?"</p>
<p>"But I didn't win."</p>
<p>"You know what I'm talking about."</p>
<p>"Mom, Laney said that I can have her snacks." [Laney doesn't know how to say that.] 		</p>

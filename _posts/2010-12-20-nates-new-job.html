				We have been blessed with jobs since Nate finished school. Which is great because we need to start paying back student loans. Not fun. Well, he started a new job a few weeks ago. His previous job was not something he enjoyed even though they paid well. And it was only a contract position until March then they were going to give him a full-time offer. We didn't want to wait that long for benefits. So when another opportunity came, we took it.</p>
<p>He now works for a company that he actually interviewed with a year ago. And as they were about to hire Nate, they had a new CFO who came in and laid a bunch of people off, including the department Nate was going to work for. Well, a year later, they asked him to come in for another interview and he got all set up to work there the following week. He is still doing side jobs for the previous contract job here and there until they find someone to fill his spot. We are just glad to have work and a steady paycheck. And that health benefit thingâ€¦ Well, it will start January 1st. I cannot wait to call and cancel our independent insurance!</p>
<p>He loves this new place. It sounds like a party place to me. That first week of work, his boss took him out to lunch. Then later in the week the entire tech department took him out to a welcome to the company lunch. Then two weeks ago, they let everyone in the office leave early on a Friday. Just called it a day at 2 p.m. They have an office candy bowl. And other fun stuff going on there.		</p>

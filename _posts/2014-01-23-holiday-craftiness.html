<p>
				I actually got crafty again this holiday season. I've been too busy to do crafts so it was nice to dive right back in. The girls played play dough and made a play dough snowman since we haven't had any snow this winter. Nate has been working on weekends so I've been trying to find things to keep the kids occupied without fighting each other too much or in front of a screen.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8067" alt="131207_00008" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131207_00008.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8068" alt="131207_00009" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131207_00009.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>I crochet Laney a scarf since her previous scarf was too small and was orange, Lai Lai's color. I also finished up a few unfinished projects here and there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8069" alt="131207_00010" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131207_00010.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>I crochet Lai Lai a hat. She wanted an orange hat. I thought it turned out pretty cute.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8070" alt="131209_00014" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131209_00014.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8074" alt="131224_00036" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131224_00036.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>I also made a bunch of these treat bags for Kenzie and Laney's classes. We ended up making about 50 of them. Luckily they were easy to put together. We just put some candy inside.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8071" alt="131213_00026" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131213_00026.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8072" alt="131213_00027" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/131213_00027.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>I also painted that big canvas with the lights. That was my favorite craft I did this holiday season. I thought it turned out pretty cute. And I painted the wooden initials on the stockings so we can all easily identify each other's stockings since we all pick a different stocking each year.</p>

<p>
				I have so many things to be grateful for this year. We have been blessed beyond our means. Really.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Husband and kids.</strong> Everyday I love them more. They make me smile, they make me laugh and they make me appreciate every moment I have with them. And they love me no matter what.</li>
<li><strong>My family.</strong> They are the greatest. They supported and encouraged us through everything. They love us no matter what. And I am so lucky to live so close to most of my aunts, uncles and cousins. I love it when we get together.</li>
<li><strong>Nate's job.</strong> Nate has had a job since he finished school. We have been so blessed with that. In this economy, a job is hard to come by. And we know what it is like to be unemployed for a long period of time. So we are happy to be getting a steady paycheck again. It has been a while since we've had that in our lives. Hooray! The job Nate is currently working has actually ended yesterday (Wednesday). He quit that contract job as he received a better offer from another company. He starts this new job on Monday. Congrats, Nate!</li>
<li><strong>Amazing friends.</strong> They are wonderful people. They don't judge me or make assumptions about me. Women love to do that. And I'm so glad I have friends who actually got to know me and are not critical of what I am doing or not doing. I love it when they call just to chat and see how I am doing. I love getting together with them. And they understand when I am busy and can't do stuff with them. They don't get offended easily. And they don't care for drama. I loved President Monson's talk at the General R.S. Broadcast called Charity Never Faileth.</li>
<li><strong>Nate finished his MBA.</strong> So glad that we survived those two years of him being gone all the time. There were some rough moments. And the girls and I missed him a lot while he was gone. But thanks to the support of family and friends we were able to get through it. And now he has his master's! He's awesome.</li>
<li><strong>My calling.</strong> I love working with the YW in our ward. They are such great youths and they teach me so much. I love having the opportunity to serve.</li>
<li><strong>Our home.</strong> I love our house. It's at the perfect location. And although it's not a big house, it's just what we need. And although we don't have nice furniture or fancy decorations, it still feels like a home to us.</li>
<li><strong>My garage and garage door opener.</strong> So glad to have one, especially in the winter when it's cold outside. Don't have to defrost.</li>
<li><strong>Our Disney vacation.</strong> It was much needed. And we all had such a great time.</li>
<li><strong>Hot showers.</strong> It's how I relax at night. It's when ideas pop into my head.</li>
<li><strong>Sleep.</strong> I love sleep. I'm one of those people who needs 8-9 hours of sleep to function.</li>
</ul>

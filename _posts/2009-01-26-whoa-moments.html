				Part of the constant blogging lately is to let you know that I'm not in labor yet. And lately, I have noticed some moments that I should jot down.
<ul>
<li>This past Thursday at 6 a.m., Kenzie woke up and said she needed to go to the potty. I took her, then put her back in bed. She did it again this morning at 5:30. Now that's a big girl! She is in panties through the night, so I'm glad that she is able to wake up and know she needs to go rather than doing it in her bed!</li>
<li>As of last Thursday, my wedding ring doesn't fit anymore. It's mostly the knuckle part. But I guess I have swollen a bit this last week of pregnancy. So different than last time when I couldn't fit my ring at 6 months. I was able to wear it yesterday, though.</li>
<li>Nate launched the website for his first client last week. Hurray! I'm so proud of him. So many enduring hours of work, hopefully it will all pay off soon.</li>
<li>I have been craving sugar the last month of pregnancy… meaning I gained 9 pounds in one month! So my pregnancy weight is at 29 pounds- a huge difference from the 45 with Kenzie!</li>
<li>Kenzie is learning to sound out letters of the alphabet and count up to 20. She will be 2 1/2 next month. She is going to be one of those kids who will be bored in school because she already learned so much before entering school. Nate is proud of his smart daughter. I'm, on the other hand, having nightmares about her going to school.</li>
<li>Kenzie acts and talks like a 4-year-old. We are already having conversations like… Kenzie to me: Mom, Daddy said this and this. But I told Daddy no, I want to do this and this. But Daddy said no.</li>
<li>Kenzie understands that adding an "s" to the end of words make it plural. And adding "ed" to end of words make them past tense. </li>
<li>She absolutely loves going over to my parents' house. She loves playing with all the fun and exciting toys there, helping her Dudepa build fires or feeding chickens, playing beauty shop with Puo Puo, watching movies, and just hanging out with them.  </li>
<li>She doesn't take naps everyday anymore, but she still has quiet time in her room for about 2 hours on days when she is not napping. </li>
</ul>

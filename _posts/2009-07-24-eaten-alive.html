				My biggest beef with the outdoors is bugs. Last night we were outside for a joint activity with the youth. I stood outside watching the youth playing kiddie pool baseball for an hour. In that hour, I got about 10 mosquito bites. The mosquitos must enjoy the Chinese flavor in their food. In my family, mosquito always prefer my mom, my brother, and I more than my dad (who is not Chinese). My dad would call me his mosquito repellent. When we're outside together, I am usually covered in bites whereas he would have none. Darn you, mosquitos.		</p>

				It was Monday, President's Day, and Nate stayed home with the girls all day. I took off in the morning working out in the gym. Then I changed clothes at the gym then took off the Target and ran some errands. I worked on organizing my Lightroom as I am still transferring photos from Aperture over. It's probably going to take me years to do. I finally finished one year's worth of photos. I am only doing a month at a time. I go through to delete all the unwanted pictures then tag them all. Put some of them into folders. It's quite the arduous process. But it's liberating to clean all that out. I just wished I didn't have so many pictures to go through! Hehehe. </p>
<p>I took myself out to lunch at Atlanta Bread Company. Then worked on LR the rest of the time. For dinner we went over to our friends' house and had a Cafe Rio night. Super yummy food. Great company. Great day. I'm so blessed with a husband who let me and also encourages me to take time for myself. He's so amazing. </p>

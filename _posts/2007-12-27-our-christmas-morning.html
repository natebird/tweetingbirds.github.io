				I hope everyone had a wonderful and memorable Christmas. We sure had fun opening gifts with Kenzie now that she understands what is happening. Here are the highlights of our Christmas morning. We didn't open gifts until about 11 a.m. because Kenzie slept in until 10 a.m. and we didn't get her out of bed for another half hour. It took all of us a while to open gifts, not because we had so many, but because Kenzie didn't care to open any after she found my new Chapsticks in my stocking. That was all she wanted and she played with them all morning. She did enjoy her new large Doodle Pad she got from us. Nate and I had a bunch of little gifts for each other since our computer was considered the big family gift this year, even though we opened it about a month ago. Enjoy the pictures!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R3PFm-tV2JI/AAAAAAAAA3Q/DwA1X_WY_7g/s1600-h/IMG_7066.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7066.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5148676072473483410" /></a><br />Coming down the stairs Christmas morning. She wouldn't let Nate change her diaper because he told her Santa came.</p>

She knew it was from Santa because it had his picture on the wrapping paper.</p>

That was all she wanted for Christmas. She went around putting Chapstick on her lips and on mommy and daddy's lips the rest of the morning.</p>

She drew pictures for us all day.</p>

Nate was trying to take a picture of me opening a gift and Kenzie kindly stepped in front of the camera completely blocking me from the picture and made this face. She is holding the pen to her Doodle Pad.		</p>

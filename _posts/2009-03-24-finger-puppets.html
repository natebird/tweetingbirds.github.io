				Nate had spring break last week, which meant he was home on a Monday night. I took advantage of that by planning a short FHE out of the new <a href="http://www.lds.org/library/display/0,4945,8184-1-4470-1,00.html">Nursery manual</a>. Kenzie offered the opening prayer. Then we learned a new song, <a href="http://www.lds.org/churchmusic/detailmusicPlayer/index.html?searchlanguage=1&amp;searchcollection=2&amp;searchseqstart=189&amp;searchsubseqstart=%20&amp;searchseqend=189&amp;searchsubseqend=ZZZ">"Family Prayer,"</a> from the Children's Songbook. Did some finger play. Read a story using finger puppets. And ended with ice cream sundaes for dessert. Kenzie loved it. Laney wasn't quite sure what to think of it all, but she was reverent and participated throughout the whole thing.</p>

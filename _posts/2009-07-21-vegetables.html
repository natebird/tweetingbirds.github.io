<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://picasaweb.google.com/lh/photo/ln31fZ2JpUYtCAA2l_R4Zg?authkey=Gv1sRgCNz_meyB5rSv5wE&amp;feat=embedwebsite"><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/carrots.jpg" /></a></div>
<p>She started eating vegetables a couple weeks ago. We started out with carrots, then squash, and now green beans. She loved them all.</p>
<p>I also forgot to post about her last wellness check. The nurse at the pediatrician's office was so impressed by Laney sitting up all on her own at 5 months. She even called other nurses to come in and see. She was 25 1/2" tall and weighed 17 1/2 lbs.</p>
<p>Laney is at such a fun age. She sits and plays. Not yet mobile. However, she has been trying to craw a bit. She wants to get in the middle of everything. Doesn't want to miss out on any fun that her sister may be having.
<div></div>
<div>I finally got her down on a consistent routine of awake for 2 hours, nap for 2 hours, and sleeps through the night for 11-12 hours straight. She is such a trooper for when we are out and about. Sleep is a top priority in our house because I don't function well without a good 8-9 hours each night. </div>

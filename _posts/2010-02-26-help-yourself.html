				I come down to the kitchen. First thing I see…</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S4LBxFadtaI/AAAAAAAAF4c/elmzTIYiiYs/s1600-h/IMG_2142.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2142.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
<p>Then I saw this…</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S4LB1YAvNdI/AAAAAAAAF4g/R7cD_1yzFzQ/s1600-h/IMG_2148.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2148.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
<p>Mind you, this was around 11 a.m. I asked…</p>
<p><b>Tiffany:</b> Kenzie, did you eat all 3 cupcakes?<br /><b>Kenzie: </b>I sure did. I had an early snack.<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> First of all, we don't eat cupcakes this early. Second, you're supposed to ask first before you eat snacks.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> [not remorseful at all] Sorry, mom.</p>
<p>Later, Nate came down for lunch to seeing the same thing.</p>
<p><b>Nate:</b> Kenzie, did you eat all the cupcakes?<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> Yes. For my snack. I was supposed to ask first. But I'm still happy.		</p>

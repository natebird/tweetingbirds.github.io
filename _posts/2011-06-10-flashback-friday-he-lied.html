<p>Things continued for Nate and I after Ryan proposed. But it didn't take long for Nate to move our relationship right along. Exactly a week after the Homecoming football game, Nate kissed me. Yup. He lied. He said he was a slow mover. Famous last words, right? Only after dating for two weeks he kissed me and told me he loved me. All in the same night. We were in my apartment hanging out just the two of us when it happened.</p>
<p>Nate said he had wanted to kiss me before then. But he decided he was going to wait until the following weekend to kiss me. He even told him roommate, Taylor, that. But he couldn't wait any more and kissed me on Thursday. Nate had been a slow mover in all the other relationships. But he said things just felt right with me.</p>

<p>Nate had prayed about dating me after the Ryan's proposal. And he just had a really good feeling about it. So he felt it was fine to move things right along. However, I was just having a great time dating Nate with no intentions of getting serious any time soon. I was the one who was holding back, which I had good reason for doing so.Â I was still a little hesitant since we had only been dating for a couple weeks and things were going much faster than I had expected it to. But when I was with Nate, everything felt right. And I was having such a great time with him. We spent a lot of time getting to know each other all the while giving each other space to do our own things.</p>

<p>However, everything in our relationship just fell into place. We didn't have any major problems or red flag. There was a little bit of our rough patch at the beginning with the whole Ryan thing. But once that was over, it really was smooth sailing for the two of us. We spent so much time together and made an effort to see each other everyday with our busy schedules. Nate worked at the BYU computer labs. I worked at the Multicultural Student Services and at the BYU Bookstore. I was also a reporter for The Daily Universe (BYU newspaper) and I had dance practices in the evenings. All this on top of being full-time students.</p>
<p>We had a great time dating. We went to a lot of BYU hockey games. We went on group dates with our roommates. I met his aunt and uncle from Arizona while they were in town. We had game nights with friends. We studied together. We didn't really care what we were doing as long as we were together.</p>

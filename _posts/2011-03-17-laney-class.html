<p>Laney wants to be like her big sister and go to dance class. It's gotten pretty bad. She spend an entire Saturday telling Nate and I that we need to take her to her dance class. She even got her leotard on and pink shoes that she calls her dance shoes. And every time we tell her she doesn't have class she cries.</p>
<p>Every week when Kenzie has her dance class, Laney also wants her leotard and shoes on thinking she gets to go to class too. And when we get to class, Laney tries to line up with the big girls to walk in class. Many times she has snuck into the classroom and lined herself up right next to the teacher, Ms. Neta. She cries and screams when I take her out. Ms. Neta has been really sweet about it and allow Laney and another Â younger sister of another girl in Kenzie's dance class come in at the end when they do bubble and stickers.</p>
<p>Right now she is a little too young for dance class but I am not considering putting her in a ballet or tumbling class this summer when she's 2 1/2. We'll see. She's very anxious for class.</p>

				Kenzie: Mom, yesterday I had a bad life.</p>
<p>Tiffany: What was so bad about it?</p>
<p>Kenzie: It was destroyed.</p>
<p>Tiffany: What destroyed your life?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I wanted Laney to play with the toys nicely but she didn't want to. She pushed me instead.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Wow. How traumatizing.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yes. I know!</p>

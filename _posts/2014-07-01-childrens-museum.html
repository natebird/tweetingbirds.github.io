				After getting back from the beach, Nate left for his work trip. But Cyndi stayed with us for a few more days. We took the girls to the Children's Museum in Atlanta. We had never been there before. I bought a Groupon for it. The girls had a blast and we were there for about 5 hours and they didn't want to leave. It was fun that one time but I don't think I will bring the girls back to it because it's was small and tailored more towards younger children. </p>

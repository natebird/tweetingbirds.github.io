<p>
				The oldest…</p>
<p>She colors neatly in the lines. She needs to be given instructions so she knows exactly how to do things. She likes to succeed in everything she does. She is orderly. She is obedient. She is willing to do what is asked. She chooses the right. She sometimes thinks she is Miss Know-It-All. She is academically smart. She has a big imagination. She doesn't mind playing by herself. Sometimes prefer it that way - time away from her sisters. She likes to act and narrate as she plays. She likes to tell her sisters what to do. She needs things to be her way and work out just right. She is a rule follower. She has a sweet tooth. She loves to be crafty and draw. She is skinny minnie, can't find pants to fit her tiny waist. She is a little awkward with her long arms and legs, but tumbling and dance classes are helping. She is sympathetic. She is my special helper. She is a reader and a writer.</p>

<p>The middle child…</p>
<p>She colors using two hands because it's faster. She does things her way and it's not how anyone else is doing it. She is creative and has an imagination of her own. She is unconventional. She thinks outside the box. She is witty and funny. She is sneaky. She will test the limit, then ride on the line. She doesn't like to be told what to do. She does things on her own terms. She is persistent and doesn't give up easily. She is loving and caring to others. She is shy outside of her comfort zone. She is afraid of thunder. She likes to know how things work and why. She is spunky and has a carefree attitude in life. She knows how to have a good time. It is hard to figure out what she will eat, she is a pretty picky eater right now. She is a self learner, observant of things around her. She has a natural athletic, physical ability. She loves nature and the outdoors.</p>

<p>The baby, who is not really a baby anymore…</p>
<p>She plays with a tall lamp that will surely fall on her but it makes a fun jingling sound when shaken. She is showing similar personalities as the middle child. She likes to try to do things she is not supposed to. She is cleaver and figures out how to get what she wants. She is a good eater (all my kids were good eaters until they are 2 years old). She is quite happy unless she doesn't get what she wants, then she yells and cries. She loves to play with her sisters and be involved in whatever they are doing. She started walking on her own at 9 months. She is fun spirited and loves to laugh. She is pretty good being towed around everywhere her sisters need to be. She is also sneaky and curious. She is starting to lose some of her chubbiness but still so cute. She is much happier now that she can walk and get into stuff. She loves to knock down anything her sisters build with blocks or Legos.</p>

				Today, Nate's twin brothers, Mitchell and Michael, entered into the MTC today. Over lunch, Nate and I were having a conversation about it with Kenzie next to us listening in.
<div></div>
<div><b>Tiffany:</b> Your parents dropped Mitch and Mike off at the MTC today. Had to do the curbside drop off because of the swine flu.</div>
<div><b>Nate:</b> I think the MTC has been wanting to implement that for a while now, even before the swine flu. It's better that way. It's probably easier for the family to say good bye outside rather than going in and spending all that time then watching them walk away. Less dramatic. </div>
<div><b>Kenzie:</b> [singing] And I'm all aloneâ€¦ there is no one here beside me. And my problems have all gone, there is no one to deride me. </div>

				Laney is really good at playing with Legos. I am impressed with how much she loves to play with the Lego Duplos we have. In fact, that's why I decided to get her the regular, smaller Legos for her birthday. She can create so many different things with them. And I have no idea where she is coming up with the ideas to make stuff with them. So creative and I love that it helps her to use her imagination. She comes up with these ideas herself. She plays with them more than the other girls. I love it.</p>

<p>She made this one all by herself by standing on that green chair next to it. Couldn't believe she got it that high. </p>

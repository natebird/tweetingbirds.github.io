				I hosted my very first girl's night with a few of my girlfriends and we had a blast! We all really needed it with the most recent flu/cold illness going around hitting everyone's household and the stress of motherhood. We had a group of 6 ladies and we sat around, ate, and talked. There was a movie playing in the background, but we didn't watch hardly any of it. Unfortunately, I forgot to get a picture. But I'm sure we'll do it again, hopefully soon.		</p>

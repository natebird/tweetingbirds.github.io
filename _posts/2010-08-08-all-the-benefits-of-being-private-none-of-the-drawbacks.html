				One of the things I didn't like about Blogger was that when you set your blog to private it meant that family/friends you couldn't subscribe to the feeds in a feedreader such as <a href="http://reader.google.com">Google Reader</a>, <a href="http://reederapp.com/">Reeder</a>, <a href="http://netnewswireapp.com/">NetNewsWire</a>, etc. These applications allow you to keep track of a lot of blogs and news sites without having to open your web browser and visit each one. You can scan the headlines and pick and choose which articles you have time for.</p>
<p>On WordPress we have the best of both worlds. The blog is set to private which means if some random person visits the blog then they can't get it or read any of our posts but our friends and family can subscribe to the blog and get updates in their newsreaders! Hooray!</p>
<p>Just click the "<a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/feed/">RSS</a>" link (it stands for <strong>Real Simple Syndication</strong>) in your browser if you have a feedreader already setup. If not, then you can setup one of the ones I linked to above. You can also click <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/feed/">here</a> and subscribe.</p>

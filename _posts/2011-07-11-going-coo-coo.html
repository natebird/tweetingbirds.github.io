				I'm going a little crazy right now. Things have been so busy here that I've been extinguishing one fire at a time and only worrying about it once it has happened. No time to prep or prevent things from happening. Sooner or later I'll be in labor and we'll have nothing ready for the baby! The car seat is still up in the attic, no hospital bags packed, nothing planned or schedule for the other children. Can I complain for a sec?</p>
<ul>
<li>We are so off our schedules lately. The kids are not going to bed until 9 p.m. or later. Totally not getting ready for school to start in less than a month.</li>
<li>This summer has been so jammed packed full of things on our to do list. It includes fun things as well as things around the house. And somewhere in there we are kind of getting ready for the baby's arrival.</li>
<li>We bought a minivan about two weeks ago. We had to get that done in June because July and August would be too crazy. I'll post pictures and write more about the vehicle later. But last week, we had to take it back in to the dealer for them to put leather on it. So it was just one more thing to do as we were trying to pack and head out to see Nate's parents.</li>
<li>Nate put the Mazda for sale on Craig's list on Tuesday night. We received several phone calls and had people interested in seeing it the next day. So we had Wednesday and Thursday to try to get it off to someone. And this being our first time selling a car, we had to figure out how to do it.</li>
<li>With the minivan, we couldn't fit the Honda and the minivan in the garage with all the stuff that's in there. I wanted to have both cars in the garage for when we are gone. So the Friday before 4th of July we bought a tool shed for the backyard. Saturday Nate and my dad started cutting into the hill that's in our backyard. Then my dad came back on Monday (4th of July) and the two of them worked 8 hours leveling the yard and putting together the shed.</li>
<li>With the shed finished, Nate cleaned out the garage so we can put both cars in the garage. We also took a lot of stuff to Goodwill.</li>
<li>I had a few sewing projects I needed to get done before our trip. So I was hitting the sewing machine pretty hard the week we were leaving. I made two clutches and a tutu skirt.</li>
<li>I had a phone call with a website that was interested in having me as one of their paid contributors. So I was trying to gather info about that also before we left.</li>
<li>Last Thursday, the day before our trip I had a lady come see the Mazda and she purchased it. So we had to get the title transferred over to her and get that done. I was doing a couple loads of laundry. I tried to get Kenzie into the pediatrician because she has been having this cough that won't go away. But I ended up having to cancel the appointment and hope for the best while we were on our trip. I also had to start packing and get things ready for us to leave early Friday morning. Had errands to run -bank, library, etc. Clean the house.</li>
<li>Kenzie had a pee pee accident last Tuesday and Wednesday. Really, child? She's 4, almost 5, and she's having accidents now?</li>
<li>I had to find subs for my primary class for two Sundays that I'll be gone. And figure out with the Primary president what to do when I have the baby for my two primary callings.</li>
<li>Kenzie cares too much about what others are doing and saying. She thinks that just because Laney says something that means it's going to happen or that's how things are.</li>
<li>Laney refuses to wear clothes. She wants to stay in her pajamas all day.</li>
<li>Laney is one stubborn child. She wants things her way and that's it. She wants to be in control of things.</li>
</ul>

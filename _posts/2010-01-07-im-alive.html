				No. We didn't drop off the face of the earth. Yes. I know I haven't written anything since Christmas and now we are well into the next year. Sorry. I will be back soon with updates and tons of pictures. As soon as I can get some order back in my life. It's sooner than you think. I'm hoping.</p>
<p>I do want to share this with you…</p>
<p>Talking to my mom on speaker phone on my cell phone.</p>
<p><b>Kelly:</b> [couldn't hear Kenzie well over the speaker phone] Where are you, Kenzie?<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> I'm still in Georgia.</p>
<p>-AND-</p>
<p>Nate wanted to calm Kenzie down to get ready for bed.</p>
<p><b>Nate:</b> Come here, Kenzie.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> Why?<br /><b>Nate:</b> Because I want to talk to you.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> What do you want to talk to me about?<br /><b>Nate:</b> I don't know. What would <i>you</i> like to talk about?<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> [without hesitation] I would like to talk about why you married mommy.<br /><b>Nate:</b> Huh. OK?		</p>

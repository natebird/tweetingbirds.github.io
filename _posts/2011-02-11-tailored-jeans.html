<p>
				I had a couple pair of jeans that were too big for me at the waist and so I decided to attempt to tailor them. My problems with jeans is I don't like having my love handle hanging out. But the waist is usually too big because I need the larger size to fit my humongous hips. Oh the joy of being pear shaped after birthing 2 kids. Anyway, I thought I would try to make the waist smaller and it worked. But I have decided that it's probably not worth the time and the trouble.</p>

				Starting this New Year, Kenzie decided she needs one of her stuffed animals to sleep with her at nap times and bed times. When it's time to sleep, I would ask Kenzie, "Which one of your animals or baby is tired?" Then she goes around picking the one animal who is tired. I only let her take one stuffed animal to bed because I don't want to have a whole farm in her crib. She has been rotating between her baby doll, her little Kitty, or her lamb.</p>
<p>But yesterday, when I asked her at nap time who was tired, she said, "Baby." I told her to go get the baby and the baby's night night (what she calls blankets). She got her night night then headed toward the stairs. I saw the baby still laying on the floor in the living room. So I said, "Kenzie, you didn't get the baby. Is the baby tired?" She responded, "Quack, quack." I was a little confused because she doesn't have a duck stuffed animal. I went back to the living room to get her baby. But when I looked at her, she showed me her duck who was tired. A while ago, my brother, Elder Jeffrey Ping, sent Kenzie one of those "Grow Your Own" ducks that you put in water and it grows up to 600% of its original size. That's who she wanted to sleep with!</p>
<p>For her nap time yesterday, I tucked that little miniature duck in bed next to her. She slept and when I got her after her nap, I found the duck on the floor next to her crib. She had thrown him out sometime during the nap. Here are some reenactment pictures of Kenzie and her duck.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R6jAr1VP3_I/AAAAAAAABPA/_yuVblm0Tf0/s1600-h/IMG_7277.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7277.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5163588832063381490" /></a><br />That's the duck on the left.

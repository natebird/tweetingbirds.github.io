				Sitting at church during the sacramentâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, why are there only two guys up there with the sacrament and not three?</p>
<p>Tiffany: Because they only need two priesthood holders to bless the sacrament. One for the bread and one for the water. Sometimes they have three to help break the bread and hand out the water.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Oh. Where do they get the bread?</p>
<p>Tiffany: The young men in the ward take turns bringing the bread for the sacrament for everyone.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Do they bring lots and lots of bread so everyone can have some?</p>
<p>Tiffany: They usually bring one loaf of bread and then break each piece into small pieces.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Where do they get the tiny cups for the water?</p>
<p>Tiffany: The ward orders them from the church. They church have them.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Oh. So the church is like a tiny restaurant. They have their own cups.		</p>

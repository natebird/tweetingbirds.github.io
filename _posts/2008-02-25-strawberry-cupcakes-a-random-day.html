				Tonight for family home evening, Kenzie and I made strawberry cupcakes while Nate helped a family move into our ward. We had a great time just the two of us, as you can tell in the pictures below.</p>
<p>Today, I also took Kenzie to get her Hepatitis A shot, finally. She couldn't get her shot two weeks ago at her wellness checkup because she had a fever. So we went back to her pediatrician's today and had a much better experience than last time. She was still scared of the nurses checking her, but she didn't cry or whine as much as last time. She got the one shot and cried, but was better the next minute, especially when they gave her a princess sticker at check out. Random times throughout the day she would point to her thigh, where she got the shot, and say, "Ouch."</p>
<p>We also received Kenzie's passport today in the mail! I can't remember if I mentioned it before or not, but we are hoping to go to Taiwan in June with my parents. My mom is still working on getting the plane tickets. It will be a great trip if we make it because I haven't been back since I was 7 and Nate and Kenzie have never been there. We will be visiting my family on my mom's side. It'll be interesting since they haven't seen me since I was 7-- I've change quite a bit since then.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8N43QScUYI/AAAAAAAABZw/yrpTI9ubixY/s1600-h/IMG_7404.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7404.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171109687811920258" /></a></p>

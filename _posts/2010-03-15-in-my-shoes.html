				OK, you caught me. I'm behind again. Want to know why? Here's why. To all who ever thought… <i>Oh, she's a stay-at-home mom. What does she do all day?</i>&nbsp;<b>OR</b> <i>Why is she complaining she is so busy all the time? I also juggle kids, a home and everything else and I don't complain. </i><b>OR</b> <i>Oh, she is one of <b>those</b> moms who doesn't watch TV because she has "better things" to do.</i>&nbsp;<b>OR</b> <i>I have not idea how she does it all? She's not human.&nbsp;</i><br /><i><br /></i><br />I'll share with you my secret. It's not what you think. I'll tell you what my days are like, mostly because I want to record what our life is like right now.</p>
<p>First, my husband is in the process of his master's degree. He goes in the evening 3-4 times a week. Drives downtown. No online classes. He usually gets home around 10 p.m., in the summer semesters around 10:30 or 11 p.m. Sometimes later when he needs to meet with his groups for case studies. Occasionally he has to meet with group members on the weekends. Nate has been doing fall, spring (some call it winter) and summer semester with a week off between semesters.</p>
<p>Second, my husband works a full-time job. Yes. That's right. After over a year of unemployment. He is working again. He started in January. It has been such a blessing for us. But that means we see less of him even though he works from home. He works at a desk upstairs with the door closed otherwise he won't get anything done. We pretend he isn't there. He tries to come have lunch with us because it's one of the few moments he sees the kids. But when work is busy, at least a couple days a week, he eats lunch while he works.</p>
<p>So, with Nate gone all the time, I am playing the role of a single mom. The only way I function is running on a routine. The routine is flexible because sometimes there are other things going on. The routine goes something like this…</p>
<ul>
<li><b>7:30-8:00 a.m.</b> kids awake</li>
<li><b>8:00-9:00 a.m.</b> Nate takes kids downstairs and feed them breakfast. So the kids get to see him for at least an hour each day.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>9:00 a.m.</b> Nate goes to work. I take over by getting them dressed and going for the day.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>10:00-12:00 p.m.</b> Laney takes a nap. Kenzie's TV time (PBS or a movie). I check my emails and work on maintenance stuff for Simply Modern Mom.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>12:00-1:00 p.m.</b> Make lunch, eat lunch, clean up lunch.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>1:00-3:00 p.m.</b> I spend time playing with the girls or teaching them something new.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>3:00-5:00 p.m.</b> Story time, then quiet time where they both take naps or just stay in their room and read books. Nate leave for school at 5, usually before the girls get up from quiet time. While the kids are down, I work on stuff for SMM.</li>
<li><b>5:00-6:00 p.m.</b> kids' snack time while I make dinner</li>
<li><b>6:00-6:30 p.m.</b> eat dinner and clean up dinner</li>
<li><b>6:30-7:30 p.m.</b> more mommy time</li>
<li><b>7:30-8:00 p.m.</b> everyone help clean up, pick up toys and get ready for bed.</li>
<li><b>8:00-8:30 p.m.</b> bedtime stories and bedtimes.</li>
<li><b>8:30-10:00 p.m.</b> I work on SMM stuff or YW stuff or whatever I am assigned to do until Nate gets home.</li>
<li><b>10:00-around 11 or 12 p.m.</b> Nate and I stay up talking about our days or I finish up my projects/SMM while Nate does homework.</li>
</ul>
<div>Then… This semester, Nate is gone Tuesdays, Thursdays and Fridays. He was gone on Wednesday for 5 weeks. That wasn't fun because I have mutual on Wednesday nights, so I had to take both girls with me. Hard to focus on YW when I had to chase after my girls.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Some days I factor in story time at the library, grocery shopping, extra church meetings, laundry days, play dates, running errands, family stuff, going to see my parents, cleaning the house, service, visiting teaching, home teaching, feeding the missionaries, etc.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>And what is it that I do for SMM that takes at least 6 hours a day? Well… I receive about 25-50 emails a day from readers, marketers, businesses, companies and other bloggers. Read and try to respond. Think of projects and plan them out. Work on projects. Take photos of my projects. Edit photos. Write posts. Edit posts. Research ideas, projects, etc. Check my RSS reader. Little maintenance stuff to the site (technical and editorial stuff). Write guest posts. Comment on readers's comments on my site or comment on a few other blogs. I contact people for projects, events and guest posts on my site.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>Weekends… Well, our weekends are usually crazy too. We are doing stuff with church, friends, family or whatever we need to get done around the house. I am gone a lot on the weekends with my church calling. I have meetings every Sunday (before or after, some Sundays both before and after). For example, this weekend…</div>
<div></div>
<div>Saturday</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>6:45 a.m. </b>Got up to get ready for temple trip.</li>
<li><b>8:00 a.m.</b> Youth baptism trip to the Birmingham temple (approx. 2 1/2 hrs away one way).&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>5:30 p.m.</b> Got back from the temple trip. Came home. Nate packed the girls into the car while I changed my clothes.</li>
<li><b>5:30 p.m.</b> Stopped a Publix to grab a family chicken meal then headed to my parent's church building for my grandparent's surprise 60th anniversary party.</li>
<li><b>6:15 p.m.</b> Arrived at the party location to help set up.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>7-10 p.m.</b> Had a great time at the party and seeing old friends.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>10:45 p.m.</b> Got home and got the kids in bed. Unload the car and get ready for church.</li>
<li><b>11:30 p.m.</b> Went to bed.&nbsp;But it was daylight savings so the clock moved an hour forward. AAAHHH!!!&nbsp;It was actually 12:30.</li>
</ul>
<div>Sunday</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><b>6:00 a.m.</b> Got up to get ready for church.</li>
<li><b>7:30 a.m.</b> Ward council.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>9 a.m.-12 p.m.</b> Church.</li>
<li><b>12:15-12:45 p.m.</b> Missionary correlation meeting.</li>
<li><b>1 p.m.</b> Got home from church. Changed clothes. Ate lunch.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>2 p.m.</b> Put girls down for naps. While I check email and catch up around the house.</li>
<li><b>4 p.m.</b> Go to a friend's 30th birthday celebration.</li>
</ul>
<p>And church… My calling can be quite time consuming. Not only am I always thinking about the YW and things for the YW program, there are a lot of meetings and events involving the youth which I also attend. Let's just say I am doing some YW or youth event 2-3 times a week. Then when RS has activities and events, I'm gone even more or take the girls with me because Nate is gone.&nbsp;</p></div>
<div></div>
<div>Pretty much the only time we are home, all 4 of us, at the same time is Monday nights. And this is the first semester Nate is home on Monday nights in 2 years. This is a huge reason why Nate and I are doing date nights once a week. Because if we don't schedule it, we won't see each other.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Hope that answers your question on what it is I am doing all day long.&nbsp;</div>

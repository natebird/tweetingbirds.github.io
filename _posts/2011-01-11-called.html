				It went like this. The last Sunday we were in church was the Sunday before Christmas. The Sunday after Christmas was cancelled due to snow and icy road conditions. Then the following Sunday was the day after New Years and we were in Kentucky while <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/01/released/" target="_blank">I was released as the YW president</a>. We got back from Kentucky on Monday night. On Tuesday night, I get an email from the Bishop asking us to meet with him Wednesday night. The both of us. And then our minds started to go off as to what callings we would be getting. I was hoping I could go to Relief Society for a while since I haven't really attended R.S., maybe 4 times the 5 years we have been in this ward.</p>
<p>Well, Wednesday came around and we were both nervous. The Bishop called us in and met with us individually at first. Then the two of us together. And the surprise was he called Nate to be the Young Men President! Nate was not expecting that at all. But he will do awesome. He's really good with youth from being their Sunday School teacher the past two years. He really connects with them.</p>
<p>So just when we thought we were going to have more family time together with me being released as YW president, now Nate will spend even more time devoted to the church since the YM includes Scouts too. He was sustained this past Sunday with his new presidency. Well, it's a good thing I am used to my husband being gone all the time.</p>
<p>We were looking at the timing of all this and thought that it was funny the last Sunday we attended the ward I was the YW president. Then we missed two Sundays with snow and travel to come back to the ward with Nate as the YM president. No time wasted at all. But that's life. We just keep going from one thing to the next and it's nice to stay busy.		</p>

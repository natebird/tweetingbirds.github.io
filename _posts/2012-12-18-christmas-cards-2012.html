<p>I ordered our Christmas cards this year from Moo.com. I've used them for business cards and stickers before. The quality of their products are great and the print quality are also amazing. And their PR people offered me $50 credit to try out their products for SMM. So I thought it would be a good opportunity to print some Christmas postcards. I did a simple design and Nate helped me with the techy stuff.</p>

<p>The postcards turned out perfect because I just put a picture on the back that gave enough room on the side to write a quick personalized note to whomever we were sending it to. We also included a half page newsletter of what each of us are up to. I had 80 cards made and sent them all off.</p>

<p>It was a lot of work, but I had to write a personal message in each one. I don't like receiving cards where the person just signed their name. I love cards that have personal messages. So I feel the need to write something personal on each card. Good thing I started early this year and got all the cards sent off by this week.</p>

				While Kenzie and I were in Utah, we stayed with my aunts, Lorna and her daughter, Marlane. They live together in Orem. It was nice to be able to stay with them and visit. Their house is already baby and kid friendly because of all their grandchildren and great grandchildren. Kenzie loved playing with the building blocks, balls, little army guys, and all sorts of other toys. By Wednesday, she knew her way around their house, knew where to get the placemat for the tables, and knew where to find the toys in the toy closet.</p>
<p>Marlane and Lorna were so generous to let me use their cars, feed us delicious meals, and let Kenzie keep the Baby Bop doll that she instantly attached herself to and wouldn't let out of her sight. Tuesday night I went up to Draper with Marlane and Lorna to visit John and Patty (Marlane's brother) and their family in their new house. They moved to a beautiful gated community right across the street from the new Draper temple. They have a gorgeous view of the valley on one side and the temple on the other side.</p>
<p>Nate came into town on Thursday and we spend that night, after all the graduation celebration, with Marlane and Lorna watching the Utah Jazz game. It was the only way for Nate to see Marlane and Lorna was by spending the night there one night since we had a packed schedule once his family got in on Thursday. It was nice for Kenzie to hang out with my family and friends because they had kids for her to play with whereas when we were with Nate's family, Kenzie was the only kid under the age of 22.</p>

<p>Kenzie playing with her cousin, Zane Hobson (he is Marlane's grandson). They were building towers together and Kenzie would knock it down as soon as Zane got it up.</p>

				We just returned from the Bird family reunion in Washington. What a trip! It was so much fun. More on this later. But before we left for Washington, <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/07/going-coo-coo/" target="_blank">we had so much to do</a>. One included selling our Mazda Protegé. We had three vehicles for two drivers when we purchased the minivan (more on that tomorrow). I wanted to get rid of the Protegé because it was the oldest vehicle and had the most milage. So late Tuesday evening Nate posted the Mazda on Craig's List. Immediately he started getting emails from people interested in seeing it. We had people come to see it on Wednesday and Thursday. But we were able to sell it to a lady who was looking for a vehicle for her son who just got his license. It was Thursday night when we finally signed it over to its new owners. Never thought it would go that quickly.</p>
<p>It was sad seeing the Mazda drive away. I bought that car while I was at BYU back in 2003, before I even met Nate. It has been such a great reliable vehicle, nothing major wrong with it. And the best thing was it got 32-34 miles per gallon. Nate drove it to work and school once I got the Accord. It has been in my life for the last 8 years. But at least it has gone to a teenage boy for him to enjoy.</p>

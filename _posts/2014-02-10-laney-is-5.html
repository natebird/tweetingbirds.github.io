				Laney turned 5 at the end of January. She had requested a long time ago that she wanted a Barbie birthday. With her birthday being shortly after Christmas, I stocked up on some Barbie gifts for her during all the Christmas sales and Black Friday. She got a set of wedding Barbie with Ken (she loves weddings much to her father's dismay), Barbie dress up clothes, Barbie dress up shoes, a Barbie movie, and a few little things.</p>
<p>It actually snowed on her birthday and was the beginning of the crazy snow storm that wiped out Georgia. But when it started snowing, Laney got super excited because it was her birthday wish come true. We got Kenzie from school early, they had early dismissal. Luckily I was able to get her home with little trouble. But with Kenzie out of school early, we were able to have more time together to celebrate Laney's birthday. We did cake and ice cream and presents in the afternoon so she had time to play with her new stuff.Â Then we all went outside to play in the snow. She said it was the best birthday ever! It was really nice, low key, but lots of fun celebrating her birthday with the snow.</p>
<p>Then on Friday, after all the snow was melted, we took the girls to Toys 'R Us because they sent Laney a birthday card and a coupon. She was so excited that the toy store remembered her birthday and sent her a coupon. She had to go to the store and use it. Great marketing skills there TRU! She picked out a My Little Pony toy and then the other two girls also walked out with something because Nate couldn't resist their begging eyes. Luckily we had a couple coupons and a gift card to help off set some of the cost. I am so glad she had a wonderful birthday.</p>

				Another year with Santa. However, Kenzie didn't cry or freak out this year! She actually was shocked to see him walk into the cultural hall. She waited patiently for her turn to sit on Santa's lap. When it was her turn, she gave him a nice big hug and answered his questions intently. I had prepped Kenzie for Santa's visit earlier that day. This was the conversation we hadâ€¦</p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, Santa is going to ask you what you want for Christmas. Do you know what you want for Christmas?<br />Kenzie: I want two presents. [holding up two fingers.]<br />Tiffany: Really? What kind of presents do you want?<br />Kenzie: [Speechless. Didn't know she was allowed to request gifts.]<br />Tiffany: Would you like some toys?<br />Kenzie: Yeah! [Jumping up and down.] I want toys for Christmas!</p>

<div style="text-align: center;">Kenzie in the middle in all pink. I tried to get her to wear Christmas colors, but we will only wear pink right now.</div>

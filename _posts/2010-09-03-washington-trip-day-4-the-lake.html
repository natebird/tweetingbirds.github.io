<p>On Thursday, Nate's dad Randy rented a boat. They used to have a boat. But it was old and so they got rid of it. They live just 15 minutes away from a huge and <strong>very cold</strong> lake. The four of us and Nate's mom got to the lake after everyone else because we were packing their lunches while the girls napped. Then once we got there, we didn't have much time because Nate needed to get back for his best friend's bachelor's party that evening.</p>

<p>Unfortunately we only had enough time for Nate and the girls to get on the tubes. I had wanted to go, but being the photographer and mom, it didn't work out. Maybe next time.</p>

<p>Our girls… They loved it. Kenzie didn't want to get off. She could have gone for hours. This was Kenzie's second time going tubing. Laney… She wasn't sure what was going on at first. This was her first time on a boat. She was a bit frightened at first and when she saw Nate jump on the tube, she was very protective and wanted her daddy to get back on the boat. That was until she decided to drive the boat…</p>

<p>I love that my girls are adventurous and willing to try new things. They had a great time. Nate's sister Nicole went out with the girls to help balance the double tube. Nicole was so good with the girls. She was always helping them and playing with them. She is going to be a great mom one day.</p>

<p>Then Nate got on the tube with his brothers… And they kept it pretty good. No harm or damage. They used to jump tubes, try to knock each other off and other crazy stuff. And don't you just love the beautiful view in the background? It was an amazing day to be out on the lake.</p>

<p>And here's Nate's parents enjoying being out on a sunny day. Ahh, life.</p>

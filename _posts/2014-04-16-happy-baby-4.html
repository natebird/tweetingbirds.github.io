				We happily welcome our newest girl, Eleanor Kay, on Feb. 19, 2014. The doctor scheduled me to be induced that day. We headed into the hospital at 6 a.m. We had dropped three girls at my parents' the night before. They spent the night there a few nights while I was in the hospital. I packed them a surprise packet for each day we were gone to keep them busy at my parents' house. Luckily it was winter break that week so we didn't have to worry about getting Kenzie to and from school and other extracurricular activities. </p>
<p>This was the first time I had a scheduled induction. So it was nice to go home, pack, and get things ready. Wednesday morning came and we headed to the hospital. It was early enough where we didn't have to worry about traffic. We checked in and everything went smoothly with the petocin. Once they broke my water, things went a lot faster. I got an epidural and shortly after I was ready to push. After about three pushes, the baby came at 1:18 p.m. She came out crying and peeing. Then she pooped on the nurse when she was cleaning her up. Nate cut the umbilical cord. I didn't have to have an episiotomy this time. Just a slight tear. First time I didn't have an episiotomy. It was nice because recovery was a lot faster and easier with just a small tear. </p>
<p>We decided on the middle name being Kay after Nate's mom. We enjoyed the rest of the day resting. Nate went home each night to sleep in a more comfortable bed undisturbed. </p>
<p>The first night, my parents brought the girls to the hospital to see the baby. They all got to hold her and say hello. They didn't come on the second day. Nate came back and hung out pretty much all day. Then went to pick up the girls later in the afternoon from my parents'. I was discharged by noon on Friday. I was more than ready to get home. I was so over eating that cafeteria food. </p>
<p>The baby came 8 pounds 2 ounces and 19.75 inches long. She was my second smallest baby. Laney was the smallest at 7 pounds 12 ounces. Lai Lai was 8 pounds 8 ounces. Kenzie was 9 pounds 2 ounces. She started latching on pretty good and was a great and nice baby from the beginning. We are so blessed to have her in our lives. She is so sweet and such a good baby so far. </p>

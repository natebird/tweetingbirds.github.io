<div style="text-align: justify;">Well, not an actual baby. After our laptop died on us over a year ago, Nate and I have been saving our pennies for a new home computer. Yes, we have been living over a year without a home computer. How did we get by? Thankfully, Nate has his work laptop that he brought home every day for me to use in the evenings. However, since I want to spend most of my evenings with Nate and Kenzie, I only got on to do the necessities (emails, bills, check sales, etc.). And if I wanted to do anything else, I would wait until everyone is asleep and I'll stay up late typing away (like I am doing now at 11:46 p.m.).</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">So, it will be nice for a home computer that I can use during the day and it came with a nice printer too! In case you are wondering, it took us over a year to save up because it had to be a Mac with Nate being the #1 Mac fan. Although this was his first Mac purchase he has made ever, with the exception of iTunes music. He has several Mac products, but they all have been given to him, mostly from work. </div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">This is also our family Christmas gift this year. We're just going to open it a bit early because we can't wait until Christmas to open a new computer!</div>

<p>
				I have always loved photography. When I was in high school, I was in yearbook and newspaper class (I know. Shocking, right? Who knew I was going to study journalism in college?) and I got to work with film SLR cameras there. And then my high school teacher put me in a black and white film and black room photography class at Kennesaw over the summer. Loved it.</p>
<p>I also worked with a professional photographer for a few months one summer helping with weddings. I was his assistant that did all the running around for him. But I also learned from him. My parents bought me my first film SLR camera as my high school graduation gift. I still have it. It's a Canon Rebel. Been a Canon girl from the beginning of time.</p>
<p>In college, I took a photojournalism class. I thought about doing a minor in photography at BYU, but they didn't offer that. Only majors in photography and I couldn't fit it into my schedule.</p>
<p>Even then I still didn't learn the functionality of a camera and the concepts of photography. It was mostly just composition and stuff like that. I didn't really start learning the art of photography until I bought my first DSLR camera in July 2009. But when I got the camera, I wanted to learn to use it to it's capacity. Now a days, a DSLR camera is pretty affordable and just about anyone can have one. But people tend to think that if they have a nice fancy DSLR they will start taking better pictures. Totally not true. Sure, the picture quality is better than a point-and-shoot. But that doesn't guarantee that you start taking photos like a professional photographer.</p>
<p>I decided that if I was going to spend the money for a DSLR, I was going to learn how to use it properly. So last year, I learned how to shoot completely in manual. My camera stays on the "M" the entire time. Thanks to one of my favorite photographers, Nicole Gerulat. She has a blog that I follow. Her photography is totally my style. And I bought her Photo 101 textbook that got me shooting in manual. And at the end of 2010, she had a sale on her online photography classes. So I signed up for one. I started the class this week and it's awesome.</p>
<p>I also saved up enough money from my blogging to purchase a flash for my camera. I've got to figure out flash photography. I'm not a huge flash fan. I do mostly natural light photography but it's hard to do natural lighting at night. Flash is a whole new world for me. I'll have to read up on it. Now my camera supplies are the followingâ€¦</p>

<li>Haze filter for each lens</li>
<li>Lens hood for each lens</li>
<li>JoTotes Missy camera bag in gray and pink (got both for free!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Next on my list is the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000AZ57M6?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=simmodmom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B000AZ57M6">Canon 24-105mm f/4 L IS  Lens</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=simmodmom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B000AZ57M6" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" /> and the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0037NX6JY?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=simmodmom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=B0037NX6JY">Canon wireless remote controller</a><img style="border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=simmodmom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0037NX6JY" border="0" alt="" width="1" height="1" />. It's going to take me a long time to save up for the fixed lens but it will be worth it. One thing I learned is to purchase accessories and lenses from the brand of your camera. There is a difference between brand and generic when it comes to camera equipment.</p>
<p>I started a new Project 52 goal this year on Simply Modern Mom where I post a <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/category/glimpse-into-motherhood/" target="_blank">Glimpse into Motherhood</a> picture each week completely unedited (the photo) to see how I am progressing in my photography. It should be fun!		</p>

<p>I can't believe this girl. She is so grown up and not a little girl any more. So sad.</p>
<ul>
<li>Will be starting kindergarten on August 1. She will turn 5 the second week of school. Her birthday is right before the cut off date to start school. And since she is so excited and mature enough to start school, I'm not going to hold her back a year. I think I'll be ready by then for her to go to school.</li>
<li>Says she wants to be a scientist and a writer when she grows up. She wants to write stories about princesses, of course.</li>
<li>Loves to tell jokes that doesn't make sense. But she still thinks they are hilarious.</li>
<li>Loves to tell Laney what to do. We've been having a problem with her telling us what Laney thinks. We've been trying to discourage that because Laney needs to speak for herself.</li>
<li>Still memorizes everything. She was assigned to give the scripture in primary and she memorized her scripture in 2 days. Amos 3:7. She went up to the front and recited the scripture by herself and all the adults were shocked.</li>
<li>Is so into ballet right now. She dances and practices the routines she learn in class. I love seeing her dance around the house talking in ballet vocabulary.</li>
<li>Very forgiving. Laney will do something that bugs her or hurts her and as long as Laney says sorry Kenzie is quick to respond, "That's OK, Laney."</li>
<li>Likes to tell everyone what to do. She is always giving Nate and I reminders and telling us what we need to do.</li>
<li>She loves to talk and will chat with anyone and tell them everything. That's her strong point is her ability to communicate.</li>
<li>She loves sweets - ice cream, cookies, chocolate, candy, pretty much anything.</li>
<li>She started eating carrots because auntie Stacey told her if she wanted to go to school she had to eat carrots.</li>
<li>She is a great helper and very obedient. She also likes to clean. Very good at picking up toys and making her bed in the mornings (without asking). Nate and I don't even make our beds. Ha!</li>
<li>She has to wear a skirt with every outfit. Super girly girl and has the potential to be a high maintenance girl, although hopefully she won't. She loves to dress up and look pretty.</li>
<li>Has the brush her teeth every night even if she falls asleep in the car while we drive home from somewhere. When we get home she will wake up to brush her teeth then go back to sleep. She's her dentist's favorite.</li>
<li>Loves to draw pictures and is quite good at it too. We have her artwork all over our house.</li>
</ul>

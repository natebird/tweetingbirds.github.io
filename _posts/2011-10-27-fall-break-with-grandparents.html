				It was perfect timing that Nate's parents came to visit and see Lai Lai during Kenzie's school fall break. OK, yeah. Fall break was a month ago and I'm just now blogging about it. I'm a little behind.</p>
<p>Nate still had to work during fall break and being only 5 weeks postpartum at that time, I was nervous about being home all week with all three kids by myself. So when Nate's parent came to spend the week with the girls, it worked out perfectly. We love having Nate's parents visit us. We always have such a great time with them. I have amazing in-laws and get along with them so well. Cannot be more blessed. And of course the girls were more than excited to have grandma and grandpa in our home for 10 days. The girls didn't want them to go home. In fact, Laney is planning a Disney World trip with just her and grandma.</p>
<p>These pictures are unedited and some are from my phone. I haven't had time to edit pictures.</p>
<p>We took Grandma and Grandpa to Oo La La, a make your own ice cream store. Yum!</p>

<p>Lai Lai napping with grandpa. She loved falling asleep while being held.</p>

<p>Grandma and Grandpa helped the older girls overcome their fear of playgrounds. They did so well.</p>

<p>Grandpa was a good sport keeping the girls entertained in the car by playing dress up with them.</p>

<p>On a Saturday we went to the apple orchards to pick apples. We had so much fun up there.</p>

<p>We also went on a hayride around the apple orchard.</p>

<p>The apple orchard also had a bakery. We had some yummy apple bread and fried pies. We also introduced Nate and his parents to boiled peanuts.</p>

<p>It was great to be with Randy and Cyndi who knew lots about apples. They live in the city that once used to be the apple capital of the world. They have an orchard in their backyard. We also picked apples for Kenzie's class. They were learning about Johnny Appleseed. They were having an apple tasting party.</p>

<p>It was such a great week with Cyndi and Randy. We love it when they come. We were all sad they had to leave. There were lots of other stuff that we did. They were also here for Lai Lai's baby blessing. We went over to my parents' for a Chinese dinner. And before they left, they went to Kenzie's school to have lunch with her.</p>

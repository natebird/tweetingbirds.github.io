<p>Horrible pictures because it's still in its original 1995 package. I have turned into one of those moms who goes out of her way to do anything for her children. Even if it means paying $6.80 on eBay for a once-free toy from Burger King's kid's meals. That's right. Call me crazy. I still think I'm crazy. Nate laughed at how ridiculous this whole situation is.</p>
<p>Disney know well how to bang parents for their bucks. There once was only 6 Disney Princesses - Belle, Ariel, Snow White, Aurora, Cinderella, and Jasmine. Since they were only making millions off of princess accessories and toys, Disney decided to add a 7th princess, Mulan. The set of Disney princesses I purchased for Kenzie for potty training last year had all 7 princesses.</p>
<p>And then it happened. Kenzie was introduced to Pocahontas by her Disney Princess Sing Along DVD. Not exactly a princess, but Disney is on its way adding it as a princess once they milk Mulan for all its worth. Since then, she had to borrow the Pocahontas movie from the library to educate herself the ins and outs of this 8th "princess."</p>
<p>Ever since Pocahontas entered into Kenzie's life, she has been asking where her Pocahontas princess is. I get hit with the following phrases several times a day.</p>
<p>"Mom, I'm missing Pocahontas. Where did she go?"<br />"Mom, Pocahontas is still at the store. Maybe I can get her for my birthday."<br />"Mom, someone took my Pocahontas. We need to find her."<br />"Mom, Pocahontas is gone. She very miss me."</p>
<p>Notice how all the phrases began with Mom? This led me to my quest to find Pocahontas toy. All I wanted was a small 3" plastic figurine. Disney doesn't make it. So I looked on eBay. Back in '95 when the Pocahontas movie came out, Burger King gave out toys in their kids meals. Of course, trunktreasure on eBay had 5 of these Pocahontas figurines to sell to sucker moms like me.</p>
<p>So I bought it. $6.80 (including shipping) for a toy that was once free. What an idiot!		</p>

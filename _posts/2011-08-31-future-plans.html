				Kenzie: Mom, I want to build my own house so I can live in it.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Are you going to live in it by yourself?</p>
<p>Kenzie: No. I will live there with my husband and children.</p>
<p>Tiffany: I hope this is when you are older.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah but I don't know who my husband is yet.</p>
<p>Tiffany: You probably haven't met him yet.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Like when you married Nate?</p>
<p>Tiffany: Yup. I met your dad in college.</p>
<p>Kenzie: I think you should call him Nate the Great.		</p>

				Kenzie made this card for Grandpa Bird. I thought it was so sweet. I didn't take a picture but on the front and back of the card is a picture of syringe with magic medicine that is supposed to cure Grandpa. Our girls always have Grandpa in mind. Kenzie says she prays for Grandpa in her personal prayer each night. I love how thoughtful my girls are.</p>

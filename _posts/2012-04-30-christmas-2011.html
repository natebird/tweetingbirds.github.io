				Oh yeah. I'm finally getting around to posting about our Christmas last year. Haha! I didn't have time to edit these pictures so they are kinda dark. I'm still behind on so much stuff. Oh well. One post at a time. We had a wonderful Christmas. No snow this year.</p>
<p>So the night prior to Christmas Eve (Friday, Dec. 23) we had a photo session with a photographer for family photos. That's what Jeffrey and I got for my parents for Christmas. That night Nate and I had a party with friends so the two older girls spent the night at my parents' house. That night we had a great time at the party. But Laney got sick at my parents' house. She had a fever of 103 degrees that night. My mom gave her some Motrin and that got her through until the next morning. Later we found out that Laney had RSV that she passed around to Kenzie then Lai Lai.</p>
<p>Anyway, we went over to my parents' for Christmas Eve and to pick up the two older girls who spent the night there. It was also nice because my brother Jeffrey was here for Christmas. He had been at school in Idaho. Laney was sick but she was being a trooper about it. Plus we gave her Motrin to help her feel more comfortable. My mom did Chinese hot pot for dinner. It was very yummy. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5393" title="IMG_1859 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1859.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="347" /> Then we opened presents. We exchange gifts with just them on Christmas Eve so we can do presents at our house on Christmas morning. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5394" title="IMG_1873 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1873.jpg" alt="" width="336" height="520" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5395" title="IMG_1890 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1890.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /> This is Christmas Eve after the girls had gone to bed. Nate and I set everything up and get out the presents. We don't put out presents before Christmas Eve because we like to keep it a surprise for them and they don't try to open it before Christmas.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5396" title="IMG_1921 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1921.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="347" /> Christmas morning coming down the stairs. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5397" title="IMG_1931 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1931-1.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5399" title="IMG_1949 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1949.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /> Opening gifts from Santa. Kenzie asked for a jack-in-the-box and Laney asked for dress up clothes. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5400" title="IMG_1989 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1989.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5401" title="IMG_1998 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1998.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5402" title="IMG_2009 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2009.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5403" title="IMG_2060 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2060.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /> Their big gifts from us was a Leapster Explorer and a game to go with it. They each got one. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5404" title="IMG_2102 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2102.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /> This was the first year Kenzie got Laney a gift because they had a shopping day at school. I sent her to school with some money and only had her get a gift for Laney. She got her a pink crayon eraser because Laney likes pink and a bracelet because Laney likes to dress up. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5405" title="IMG_2110 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2110.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /></p>
<p>Lorelai got some gifts too. Some clothes and a few baby toys.</p>

<p>Nate got some clothes and a game,Puerto Rico, and guitar lessons. He has always wanted to learn to play the guitar.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5407" title="IMG_2161 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2161.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /></p>

<p>And it's not Christmas without someone crying.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5409" title="IMG_2237 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2237.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /></p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5411" title="IMG_2301 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2301.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>Kenzie's loot on the other couch.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5412" title="IMG_2303 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2303.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="347" /></p>
<p>After presents Nate's co-worker Darshan came to spend Christmas with us again. He was with us last year. He is from India and doesn't have any family here. So it was nice to have him with us. We all went over to my grandparents' house for a big turkey and ham meal and gift exchanges. It was a really nice Christmas.		</p>

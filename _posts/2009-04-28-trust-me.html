<p>
				On the way back from our birthday meal at Red Robins. Stopping for the third time. First time for a nursing break, second time for a potty break, and the third time for another potty break. Red Robins is a 40 minute commute one way from our house.</p>
<p>Tiffany to Nate: She [Kenzie] didn't go potty.<br />Nate to Kenzie: Why didn't you go to the potty Kenzie?<br />Tiffany to Kenzie: Now we can't trust you because you said you need to go potty but you didn't.<br />Kenzie: I can't trust myself either.		</p>

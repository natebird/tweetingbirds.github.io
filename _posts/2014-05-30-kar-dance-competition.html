<p>
				Kenzie's second dance competition of the year was the national KAR Dance in Atlanta over by the airport. This was the girls' first big competition and they had so much fun. It was on Nate's birthday, so we did the competition in the morning then his birthday afterwards. The girls got Top 1st in their category age group. That really means second place because there is a best overall winner. Kenzie really liked competition this year. She wants to do it again next year. We weren't supposed to take pictures of their performance on stage. So these are the pictures I took before and afterwards.</p>

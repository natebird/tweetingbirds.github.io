<p>It's official. I was released as the YW president last Sunday. It didn't come as a shock to me. I've actually been having the feeling that I was going to be release for several months now.Â I served in the YW program in our ward for 4 years- 1 1/2 as a secretary and 2 1/2 as the president. I was called to be in YW when I was 23 years old. Several months ago, I started to get the feeling that my time was coming to an end as the president. And I know it was the spirit guiding me because Heavenly Father knew it would take me a few months to prepare myself emotionally for this.</p>

<p>And then a couple months ago during sacrament meeting, a new family that just moved into our ward gave a talk in church. And as the wife spoke, I received inspiration with the clear thought that came into my mind that told me she was going to be the new YW president. I told Nate and he said, "How do you know that you'll be released?" I just knew. And like I said before, the spirit was preparing me because it knew how much I loved serving with the YW in our ward.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2613" title="IMG_6492 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6492.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></p>
<p>Then our bishop was released in the ward. We got a new bishop and Nate told me that if I was going to be released, it probably won't be until after the New Year because the new bishop will be busy doing tithing settlement. I have been in my calling the longest compared to other auxiliary leaders. I've been through changes in the Elder's Quorum Presidency, Primary Presidency, YM Presidency, High Priest Group Leaders, Bishopric counselors (3 sets), clerks, Bishop, stake presidency, stake YW presidency, ward mission leader and the ward splitting. And when we got the new bishop, one of my counselor was the old bishop's wife and she told me in our presidency meeting that he was planning on reorganizing the YW presidency but was released as bishop before he could do that. And he had told the new bishop that.</p>

<p>When the Bishop called me in, I held my cries really well. I had a whole week to prepare myself for that. The ward executive secretary told me the previous Sunday to meet with the Bishop. I knew what that was about. Then I had another week to prepare myself for the official release in sacrament meeting the next Sunday.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2607" title="IMG_2435 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2435.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>For those two weeks, I really thought about the girls. Oh how I am going to miss them. I've watched them come in as shy little beehives and leave as confident YW going to colleges. I've watched them grow and mature. I've really developed personal relationships with each YW. They are amazing, beautiful YW who are beloved daughters of our Heavenly Father. They have so much potential in this world. I love being around them and feeling their spirits and learning from them.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2608" title="IMG_2436 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2436.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>It's a mixture of feelings and I'm trying to focus on the positive. I'm just trying think about the amount of time I will have to spend with my family. The calling was very demanding on time, about 6-8 hours a week some weeks more in meetings, mutual, and all the preparations. No more chaperoning dances or youth conferences or girls camp, etc. And Kenzie won't ask if I'm going to a church meeting every time I walk out the door.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2611" title="IMG_4994 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4994.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></p>
<p>My time as the president has been some of the most challenging times of my life. Not because of the calling itself, but because of the other things happening in my life while I had the calling. It strengthened me spiritually and developed my character. I have a testimony that if the Lord asks you to do something, He will provide a way to make it happen. It may not be the way you had envisioned, but it will work. And I've worked with amazing local leaders in the ward and in the stake. And even had the opportunity to be trained by general presidencies of the church. I've had the opportunity to see how the ward function and how other people in the ward serve without even a second thought.</p>

<p>Now I'm just nervous about where I will be going next calling-wise. I hope I am able to keep serving in the church because it has been a huge blessing in our lives. Knowing the needs in our ward, I have a feeling it'll be in the Primary. I was in Primary as a teacher before I went into YW. So that'll be interesting to go back to Primary. Until then, I'll enjoy going to RS for a while.</p>

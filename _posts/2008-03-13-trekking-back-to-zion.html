				It's official! We are heading back to Utah in April! Just for a visit to see two of Nate's sisters' graduate from BYU, Natalie and Nicole. It'll also be fun for us to show Kenzie our BYU alma mater, visit with both of our families out there, and some friends who are still lingering around the area (hehehe.... no, really, Utah is a great place). I just hope it doesn't snow while we are out there, which it has happened before around finals week. As I am writing this, it is 72 degrees outside here... NICE!!!</p>
<p>Anyway, Kenzie and I will be there from April 21 to 27. Yes, I'm brave enough to fly out there with a toddler by myself. I just hope the other people on the plane will be understanding of my situation. And then, Nate will fly out April 24 to 27, because of work. We are on the same flight back home so he can help me with Kenzie. It's actually kind of weird because Nate and I have the same flight time and flying the exact same plane with the same layovers and same connection flight time and plane on the way to Salt Lake City, but just on two different days.</p>
<p>The other part of the news is that it will be my 25th birthday while I am out there in Utah! April 26, mark that in your calendars! I was hoping to make this one a big one since I'll be a quarter century old. I haven't had a big birthday since I was 16. My birthday has always conflicted with BYU's graduation or finals week when I was out at BYU for school. In 2005 it was over shadowed by both Nate and mine graduation. In 2006 it was Nate's brother, Nick's BYU graduation, which we attended. In 2007, my mom was in Taiwan on my birthday. And now, 2008, it's going to be Natalie and Nicole's graduation and a celebration of their jobs and summer studies in Alaska and India. Maybe I'll finally get a good birthday when I turn 30... hopefully no one will be graduating then. Oh wait! That'll be Nate's brother and sister, Matthew and Michelle's graduation year from BYU or BYU-Idaho. Dang!		</p>

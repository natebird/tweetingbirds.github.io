<p>It happens annually around this time of year. We gather the graham crackers, frostings and candies galore to have our family tradition of gingerbread house building contest. This is a tradition that Nathan and I started back when we were engaged. And this year, we invited our friends, Irene and Barron. They are some of our favorite people. And they're also good friends with my parents too.Â This was the first time Barron and Irene has made gingerbread houses. Hard to believe because they did so well. We missed my brother who is always the top designer in these contests.</p>
<p>First we had them all over for dinner, beef stew and salad and rolls. Nothing fancy, just warm.</p>

<p>After the feast we cleared off the table to set up for the gingerbread houses.</p>

<p>Laney got to participate for a little bit. She started getting stuffy nose and didn't take a nap that day. So we let her play for a bit then put her to bed.</p>

<p>Kenzie did awesome this year. She made her house all by herself and came up with the most creative ideas. She's a natural.</p>

<p>Kenzie's house was a princess castle fantasy land. It had a see saw, sandbox, fenced yard for the cows, hop scotch and a place where the kids played ring around the rosy. She came up with all the ideas herself and made it work.</p>

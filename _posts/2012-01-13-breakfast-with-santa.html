				Kenzie's school was having a fundraiser before Christmas. They had a breakfast with Santa. It was a pancake breakfast and then pictures with Santa. It wasn't too expensive so we all went to support her school. I was actually quite impressed that they hired a Santa with a real beard and everything. The girls had a great time and Kenzie saw some of her friends and classmates there too.</p>

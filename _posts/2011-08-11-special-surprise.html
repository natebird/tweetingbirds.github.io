				Tiffany: Today is a special day.</p>
<p>Laney: It's my birthday!</p>
<p>Tiffany: No, it's not your birthday. We're going to Puo Puo's house and then we'll have a surprise.</p>
<p>Laney: I get surprise presents?!</p>
<p>Tiffany: No. We're going to watch Cars 2.</p>
<p>We went and watched Cars 2 on opening night and it was a disappointment. We went to the theater by where my parents live and had dinner with them. Then my dad came with us to the movie. Nate and I didn't like it at all. The Toy Story short at the beginning of the movie was the best part. The kids seemed to enjoy it a bit more than us.		</p>

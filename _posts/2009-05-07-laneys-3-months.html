We had to wait on some stuff to get her in for an appointment. Anyway, our little Laney is not so little anymore. She 16 pounds (95+ percentile) and 23" tall (50th percentile) and healthy as can be. The picture of her back was when we tried to squeeze her into a 6 month size swimsuit… She will be sporting a 12 month size swimsuit this summer.</p>
<p>Still loves to kick those chunky legs all over the place. She is also trying to sit up by herself already. Not a big fan of tummy time. I'm trying to introduce her to some teething toys since she is already teething, although nothing has popped through yet. She is drooling enough for us to put bibs on her when she is awake. Loves to gnaw on her hands. Sleeps between 6-10 hours through the night. Is a light sleeper, awakens by the slightest sound. Such a happy baby, loves to smile and coo when you talk to her. Only cries when she is hungry or tired. Loves taking baths. And recently found out her toes are great fun to play with. </p>

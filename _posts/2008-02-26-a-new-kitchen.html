				Well, it's new to us. Nate and I found this kitchen at the thrift store last Saturday and got it for $5. It was pretty dirty, but thanks to my awesome cleaning skills and Lysol's disinfecting wipes, I had this kitchen looking brand new in 30 minutes. I wiped down every nook and cranny using a chopstick and a toothpickâ€¦ yes, I'm that bad. We have since moved the kitchen into the opposite corner in her playroom. Kenzie has a great time cooking up a storm. It is especially cool because the stove part of the kitchen has sound effects of boiling water, frying, and a timer. Now there's mommy's kitchen and Kenzie's kitchen.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8TaqwScUpI/AAAAAAAABb4/q906L1bLWNw/s1600-h/IMG_7400.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7400.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171498700179788434" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8TarAScUqI/AAAAAAAABcA/8JXrX9f-nFw/s1600-h/IMG_7401.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7401.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171498704474755746" /></a>		</p>

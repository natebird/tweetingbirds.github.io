<p>
				This New Years we decided to make the trip to Kentucky to visit our friends Taylor and Julia. Taylor was Nate's roommate and best friend in college. We are lucky to live relatively close to them so we can see them about once or twice a year. The last time we saw them was for Nate's 30th birthday party when they came down for that last May. So it had been about 6 months.</p>
<p>Also visiting them always mean yummy food, great company and the girls have friends to play with. They have two girls close to the same ages as Kenzie and Laney. Taylor is actually working a new job with GE and is commuting about 3 hours a day to get to his job. They are in the process of selling their current house and wanting to move closer to his new job when this house sells.</p>
<p>This visit we were able to leave Thursday after Nate's work and come home on Monday after New Years. So it was nice to be able to stay a while. We had many game nights, Julia and I went out for a girls' day out, played outside in their backyard and played the Wii a few times. Laney had a hard time sleeping there. She finally got used to it our last night there.</p>

<p>This girl is doing such a good job going to the potty. Last Saturday, a week after we started potty training, she started to go to the bathroom by herself when she needed to pee. It was awesome. She only had one accident the last few days. And it was mostly poop. We do need to remind her when we see her grabbing or dancing. And we still take her to the bathroom every hour when she hasn't gone in a long time. But she's doing pretty great. Although last Saturday she did have an accident in my car. Yikes. Oh well.</p>
<p>The pooping is still a problem because she says it hurts her bum. She has been holding it in which has made it worst. She has a fear of poop I think. And a few nights ago she kept waking up crying and saying she needed to go potty but only pee. I think her poop was hurting her since she was holding it in. We've tried to talk to her and no luck. Hopefully she'll let it out soon!		</p>

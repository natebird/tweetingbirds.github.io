				I can't help it. I look at these sonogram pictures of baby #3 and I already think she's a cutie. Yeah, I know, how can you tell in these sonogram photos? Maybe it's that mommy bias kicking in early. Kenzie and Laney are super excited about having another sister and being big sisters themselves. I'm now in my 23rd week of pregnancy (5th month). At the last sonogram they said I'm measuring a week early but the doctor isn't going to change my due date. So I'm really around 24 weeks along.</p>
<p>This pregnancy has been passing a little too quickly for me. I haven't done anything "baby" yet. No clothes, no names, nothing. I haven't started nesting either. Any suggestions for names? I haven't really started thinking about names yet. Any suggestions would be great.</p>

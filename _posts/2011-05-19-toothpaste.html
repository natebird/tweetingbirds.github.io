				Kenzie: My Shrek toothpaste is almost gone. I've been using it a long time.</p>
<p>Nate: Yeah, it has lasted a long time. I don't even remember what toothpaste you used before this one.</p>
<p>Kenzie: I had the Princess toothpaste, then the bear toothpaste and another bear one before that.</p>
<p>She just told Nate all the toothpastes she has ever used in her lifetime. I don't know how she remembers what toothpastes she has used since age 1-ish. Wow.		</p>

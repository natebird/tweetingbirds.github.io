<p>
				We kept Laney's birthday small this year because she had a big birthday party. We did the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2013/03/14-eat-at-a-local-restaurant" target="_blank">tea thing before her birthday</a>. So on the day of her birthday Kenzie had dance class. Then afterwards we went out to eat at Chick-Fil-A, her choice. We came home and did cake and ice cream and presents. My parents came along and my grandma, Ama. </p>
<p>And being the nice mom that I am, I set up her wellness check the same day as her birthday so she could get some shots. Nice, huh? </p>
<p>I can't believe this girl is 4! I love her fun spirit and quite a diva. She loves to dress up and be fancy and girly girl. She loves to play with Legos and really good at them. She is really smart and has quite the vocabulary. </p>

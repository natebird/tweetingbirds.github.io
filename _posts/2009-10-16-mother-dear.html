				Kenzie has been calling me Mother lately. I don't know where she got it from. But throughout the day, you can hear her saying things likeâ€¦
<div>
<ul>
<li>"Dinner smells delicious, Mother. Thank you." </li>
<li>"Mother, can you come get Laney? She's in my playroom."</li>
<li>"Mother, you are my favorite Tiffany."</li>
<li>"Is it time to go to church yet, Mother?"</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>Then around other people, especially adults, she calls Nate and I by our first names.</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>"Tiffany, come down here."</li>
<li>"Kelly is your mom, Tiffany."</li>
</ul>
</div>

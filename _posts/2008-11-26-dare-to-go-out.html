				Sorry about our blog becoming a potty training diary. But that is really all that is happening here. Today, I received an unexpected phone call from a sister in our ward who had grandchildren visiting and invited Kenzie and I over to play. Since it was not very often that Sis. Shoham's grandchildren visits, plus she had been wanting us to meet her grandchildren, we made the daring trek to her house to play. I did warn her that Kenzie had only been potty training for a few days.</p>
<p>I stocked up the diaper bag with three extra pairs of pants, four pairs of panties, a pair of extra socks, a pair of training diaper, baby wipes, and other normal diaper bag supplies. I also took a toilet set adaptor that made the adult toilet seat a smaller size for tiny bums. I was extra nervous that this sister's home is beautifully decorated and had expensive rugs and carpet that could easily be ruined by potty accidents.</p>
<p>We were over there playing for six hours. I was reckless the whole time, biting my finger nails, praying for no major messes. Kenzie did well to my surprise. She had only one major accident. It was over a nice fancy rug in the living room, however, to my luck, she was standing on a step stool that caught all the mess. Sigh. And the sister was very nice about the whole thing. During our time there, Kenzie did end up going through all the excess clothing I brought with me, with the exception of the training diaper and socks. Kenzie started going in her pants a couple times, but stopped herself long enough to tell me she needed to go pee pee. I rushed her to the bathroom and she finished her business in the toilet. She did that once more when we got home. So she is getting better at it, just needs more practice.</p>
<p>Kenzie seems to end the days on high notes. Tonight, she told me she needed to go pee pee after we had changed her into her sleeping panties (training diaper) and pajamas (one piece, zip up, fleece, body PJs that has the footies). Nate rushed her into the bathroom and she didn't go until she was on the toilet. Yay!</p>
<p>What I learned from today's experience: 1) I have got to stop nagging Kenzie about going to the bathroom. I need to trust her to tell me. A few seldom reminders may not be bad if I see some signs of her holding it. 2) I need to learn patience. Give her more time to get used to this idea and she just needs more practice. 3) Be encouraging and positive, even if it's only halfway successful (starts peeing in her panties but finishes in the toilet). 4) Overall, she has been pretty good about it and picked it up pretty quickly. 5) She has a hard time taking time away from play to go to the bathroom. Hopefully she will learn to get over that.</p>
<p>In the end, Kenzie had a wonderful time playing with new friends today and being in a new setting. She also had a pretty successful potty day with only one major accident. And I am so proud of my little princess who has been so willing to learn and been patient with her mother's trial and errors.</p>
<p>Happy Thanksgiving! Sorry about all the grammatical errors, I didn't have time to edit this since I'm finishing this post up at 12:12 a.m. Thanksgiving Day.		</p>

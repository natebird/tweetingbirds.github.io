<p>It has been 9 weeks today since Lai LaiÂ was born and I am just now feeling a little like I have a grip on things again. We have been cleared of sicknesses the last two weeks so that has helped. This adorable little girl has been lucky enough to not have caught any of our sickness. And just look at her. She's not a newborn anymore. She's such a cute little baby. I love her dearly.</p>
<ul>
<li>She is doing much better at napping. She can put herself to sleep with minimal or no crying. That's awesome. She does better in the morning than in the late afternoons. Usually she is so tired in the late afternoons and we have so much going at that time that she does most of her crying then. But still, it's not much crying.</li>
<li>She sleeps 7 hours straight at night now. The only thing is the 7 hour of sleep begins at 8 p.m. to around 3 a.m. So I try to go to bed at 10 so I can at least get 5 straight hours of sleep before I get up to nurse.</li>
<li>I ended up getting mastitis two weeks ago. That was horrible. Luckily the OB called in the antibiotics and once I got going on that I felt much better. That was no fun at all.</li>
<li>Her eye lashes are already longer than mine. Not fair. Our three girls were all blessed with their father's eye lashes- perfectly curled and long. No, I'm not jealous at all. [exaggeration]</li>
<li>This chunky girl is holding her head up really well. I need to get her doing more tummy time. I've been slacking on that. Although she doesn't look like she has a neck, she still holds her head up good.</li>
<li>This girl love to laugh and smile. She is such a happy baby. I love it. She is quiet. She loves to be snuggled with and held.</li>
<li>Her sisters are all over her. They love their baby sister. Sometimes a little too much.</li>
<li>She enjoys car rides. But if she is awake, and the car stops (stop signs, red lights, parking), she will that the liberty to cry at those times.</li>
<li>She is wearing 3-6 month clothes at this time.</li>
</ul>

				This girl knows how to throw an tantrum. Other girls did the tantrum thing too, but they didn't reach that age until almost 3 years old. And it was a much shorter phase than Lai Lai. She started this tantrum thing before she even turned 2. And she will cry and cry for 30-45 minutes if she doesn't get what she wants. Then when she is done, she just comes in and jumps right in with whatever we are doing. Like other girls, I have no problem letting them cry it out and ignore their tantrums. When they are ready can come tell me what is wrong. But she is cute when she is pouting. </p>

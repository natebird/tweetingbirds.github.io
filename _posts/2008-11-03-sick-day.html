				I woke up this morning with a stuffy nose and scratchy throat - not fun! Kenzie has been fighting a cold since last Thursday. She has runny nose and coughing. Now I am sneezing profusely, holding on to a box of Kleenex, and having antibacterial supplies nearby. Too bad I have a busy week ahead of me.</p>
<p>And I need to figure out a way to do a special potty training kickoff to get Kenzie psyched about potty training. Any ideas anyone?		</p>

				Kenzie: Mom, have you ever been to the circus?</p>
<p>Tiffany: No. I don't like the circus.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Why?</p>
<p>Tiffany: Because I don't like clowns.</p>
<p>Kenzie: But clowns are not scary. They are funny.</p>
<p>Tiffany: I don't think they are funny. I think they are scary.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, you have to learn to control yourself about clowns. You should wish for clowns for Christmas so you can see that they are funny and not scary.		</p>

				Yes, I am still catching up on past stuff. See how ridiculous this is?! Posting about Halloween 4 months later. Anyway, we had such a fun Halloween. Kenzie wanted to be Tinker Bell, I just happened to have a costume that I bought last year after Halloween on clearance. Laney saw a pink Cinderella costume at Walmart and it wasn't too expensive so we got that for her. Cinderella re-released this year and they came out with the pink dress that the stepsisters ripped in the movie. Lai Lai wore a costume that has been passed down from the other two girls, Piglet. We went to the ward trunk-or-treat, they had costume day at dance, and on actual Halloween, our friends Kat (the ones that moved to South Africa) and her daughter, Amy, came trick-or-treating with us in our neighborhood. They were living in a temp apartment while they were getting ready to move to South Africa. So we invited them to go trick-or-treating with us. The girls had a blast. Collected lots of candy. I gave most of it away later. Or just tossed it. </p>

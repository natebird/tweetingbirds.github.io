<p>You would have never known it talking to him now. But it's true. Nate once was a huge Dell computer fan. He thought he was the hot stuff with that Dell laptop he had in college. He got it brand new and kept the plastic on forever. That Dell died after we moved to Georgia. He even had a Dell Axim to help him be organize with school and work and fun.</p>
<p>Ha! Now he despises PCs. He's a Mac fan through and through. I wish we got a commission from Apple because he has converted his whole family and my family and a bunch of other people over the Apple products.</p>
<p>In the picture, Nate was studying at the BYU library. Nate didn't care so much about school while he was at BYU. But he's a great student now at Georgia Tech.		</p>

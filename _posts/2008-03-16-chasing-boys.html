				This is Kenzie's friend, Chase. He came over Friday night and spent the night with us as his parents were in the hospital for a family emergency. He also stayed with us for most of Saturday and Kenzie had a great time playing with him. Chase is about 3 months younger than Kenzie, but you wouldn't be able to tell since they are both the same size. They had fun laying out all the toys on the floor in the playroom and the living room. Then they sat together, Kenzie in her rocking chair and Chase in Kenzie's car seat, to watch Madagascar. They didn't sit long before taking off to play with more toys. They also took turns pushing around the little shopping cart and jumping into the ball pit. The two of them played pretty well together. <br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R91yRB1qJiI/AAAAAAAABpc/IYBwS3nd6kM/s1600-h/IMG_7744.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7744.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5178420783422776866" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R91yRR1qJjI/AAAAAAAABpk/f5-DowARSlo/s1600-h/IMG_7746.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7746.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5178420787717744178" /></a>		</p>

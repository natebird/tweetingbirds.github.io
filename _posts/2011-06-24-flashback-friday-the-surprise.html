<p>Shortly after Nate's parents left, probably the week after, he told me he had a surprise for me. Oh no. I've always been nervous of Nate's surprises and it probably stems from this very first surprise. He wouldn't tell me what it was. He made me guess over several days. In fact, he said he wasn't going to tell me until a certain date, which was like a week later. But I kept guessing.</p>
<p>When I finally guessed his surprise, I was shocked. He had bought plane tickets to Georgia to visit me during Christmas break. Without telling me or asking me if he could come visit. What?! First of all, it was beginning of November, who was thinking of Christmas break? Second, we had only been dating a month. What was he thinking buying a plane ticket to visit me and my family in Georgia? Third, how did he know we would still be dating in December? A lot can happen in 2 months. Forth, Nate was sick with a cold at the time he purchased the ticket. So I was worried that this was an impulse buy when he wasn't thinking correctly.</p>

<p>For a while I didn't tell my parents Nate was coming out during Christmas break. My parents knew I was dating someone new at this time, but if I had told them Nate was coming Christmas break, they would think it was a serious relationship. Even I didn't think Nate and I were in a serious relationship at that time. Come on! It had only been a month of dating.</p>
<p>Nate, his thought were, he was going home to Washington for Christmas. But he was flying back down to Utah the day after Christmas for Taylor and Julia's wedding (Nate's roommate and best friend) on Dec. 27. He was the best man at the wedding. Then he would be in Utah all by his lonesome self until school started after New Years. So he bought a plane ticket to Georgia without even telling me about it until after he had purchased it. Also he had made a lot of money over the summer, so he thought a $300 round-trip ticket to Atlanta was a good deal. And if we happened to be not dating at that time, then oh well. It was only $300. What?! As a struggling college student working two jobs and going to school full-time I thought $300 was a lot of money.</p>
<p>And he said that I invited him. Ha! It was more of an open invitation that I said to people who had never been to Georgia before, "Yeah, you should come to Georgia sometime." It wasn't a specific invitation to him to come meet my family or anything. I've given the same invitation to a couple of other guys I dated previously and a couple of them almost did it. Of course they were coordinating plans with me to come to Georgia during the summer or Christmas break. None of them did what Nate did. Like I said before, Nate was more confident of our relationship than I was at the time.		</p>

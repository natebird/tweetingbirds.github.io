<p>This girl is not a baby anymore. Makes my heart sink.</p>
<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She loves fruits, especially peaches,Â watermelon, strawberries, raspberries, and blackberries.</span></li>
<li>She doesn't like a dirty diaper. She says that she pooped even though it's just pee and she wants her diaper changed immediately.</li>
<li>She loves to hang with her big sisters.</li>
<li>She loves shoes, princesses and Barbies.</li>
<li>She wants to do things by herself all the time - buckle her own car seat, take off her diaper, put on her own clothes, etc.</li>
<li>She already hit her terrible twos. My other girls never went through the terrible twos but this girl is hitting it full force when she has her moments.</li>
<li>She started saying, "I don't want to!" for everything. Yeah, terrible twos. She gets you with her cute cheeks.</li>
<li>She likes to play with the big Lego Duplo, her Emma bear, choo choo trains, and whatever her sisters are playing.</li>
<li>She sleeps with an entourage of stuffed animals - Curious George, Emma (bear), Ruff (dog), blanket, baby, and naked baby.</li>
<li>She is a little spunk with so much humor. She is the jokester of the family. Always doing things to make others laugh and checking to see if they are laughing.</li>
<li>She is quite the talker. She talks a lot and loves to sing. She sings, I am a Child of God, Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, Give Said the Little Stream, Row Row Row Your Boat, and a few others.</li>
<li>She is also a dancer. She does this little hop on one leg. It's quite cute.</li>
<li>She loves to read books with anyone who will read with her.</li>
<li>She love going into nursery. She is my only child who hasn't had a problem going into nursery from day one. She got used to leaving mom from when I would leave her at the gym.</li>
<li>Still takes a nap for 2 hours each afternoon.</li>
<li>Is a water baby. Loves playing in the water. Except that one time when she almost drown at the YMCA pool. Scared me to death! But it didn't phase her too much. She didn't cry or anything.</li>
<li>Will now drink milk! Well, she will drink soy milk in a cup or regular milk in her cereals.</li>
<li>She is doing well sleeping in her big girl bed. She actually stays in the bed and goes to sleep. I'm sure she will get to a phase when she will start to get out of bed, but for now she's good about actually going to sleep.</li>
<li>She is speaking in sentences and phrases. She is quite vocal and good at expressing her thoughts. I'm always impressed at how much they comprehend and is able to say what they are thinking.</li>
</ul>

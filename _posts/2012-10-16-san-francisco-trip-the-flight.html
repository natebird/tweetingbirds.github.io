<p>We are traveling Birds. Nate and I love to travel. And when we get home from a trip, we usually start thinking about where we can go next. Most trips aren't anything major. We go visit friends or family or sightsee somewhere not too far. But back in March, yeah, I'm still blogging about things in March, we went to California.</p>
<p>This is how it all happened. So… Nate's sister Nicole was getting married on March 17 (St. Patrick's Day) to a guy she met in California named Alex. He is actually Chinese too. His family is from Hong Kong. They were getting married in the Oakland Temple, the same temple Nate's parents were married in 32 years ago.</p>
<p>At first it was just going to be Nate attending the wedding because we couldn't really afford flying all of us out to SF. Nate bought his ticket to fly out Thursday after work and coming back on Sunday. Then a few weeks before the wedding, we found out about Nate's dad's cancer. We thought about it again and decided we all needed to be there to support the family on this special occasion where all 8 kids, all grandchildren and all spouses would be there. Two weeks before the wedding, we bought tickets for all of us to head out there. We canceled Nate's first ticket because there was no way I could fly out with all three kids and all our carry-on luggages by myself. And we ended up staying longer. We left on Tuesday after Kenzie's school and came home on Sunday. Tickets were cheaper for those days. Kenzie missed only one day of school due to furlough days in the school schedule. They had Thursday and Friday off.</p>
<p>It was insanely crazy the two weeks before we left. We were part of the wedding party so I had two weeks to order my dress and get it here on time, find the right yellow dresses for the three girls who were flower girls, and get everything together for us to leave with Kenzie's school, being a room mom, church stuff, blogging, packing and getting things we needed for the flight across country with 3 girls, blah, blah, blah. But everything came together and we headed out just fine.</p>
<p>Here's a note I wrote the morning after our flight…</p>
<p>Mom and dad took us to the airport after Kenzie got out of school. When we got there, we got two SmartCarts to carry all of our stuff. People at the airport were staring at us because we went through security gates with 4 carry-on luggages, 4 backpacks, 3 car seats in various sizes, 1 laptop bag, 1 camera bag, 2 strollers and 3 kids 5 and under. We almost didn't make it because we weren't sure how we were going to get all this stuff to the gate after we went through security without the SmartCarts. We made it work. The older girls carried their own backpacks and had to walk through the entire airport, we used the two single strollers and put the connector on them so Nate can push both strollers at the same time. We put luggages on the seat of the strollers, we hung the other backpacks and laptop bag on the handle of the strollers, we put car seats on top of the luggages on the strollers. I held a 21 pound baby in one arm and pulled two connecting luggages with the other hand and had my camera bag around my shoulder. We were quite the circus act.</p>
<p>Flight from ATL to Denver was delayed because it got to the gate from the previous flight after we were supposed to take off. We thought we were going to miss our connecting flight because we had 45 minutes to get from one gate to another. It turned out that we were just fine because the connection flight was delayed 2 hours due to bad weather in SFO. I quickly ran to the only restaurant open at the airport, McDonalds, to grab some snacks while we waited 2 hours with sleepy kids. We didn't take off on our connecting flight until 11 p.m. We got complementary tv on both flights due to the delays. Oh wow.</p>
<p>We arrived in SFO to an deserted airport. It was a little past 1 a.m. California time. All three girls passed out from exhaustion and it was hard getting them all off the plane with all our luggages. Even the pilot and flight attendants helped us carry some stuff. We somehow managed to get down to where we could pay $5 to get a smartcart to help wheel some stuff. But then I left Nate with the kids at the terminal while I took the blue air train to retrieve our rental van. Of course I was at the farthest stop away from the rental car place and it was a night of rain and wind.</p>
<p>Getting the rental car was fine except I couldn't add Nate as a driver too because he wasn't there to sign for it. So here I am driving a Chrysler Town &amp; Country (so different than my van) through SF. Yikes! We got to our hotel and it's 3 am. As I was trying to check in, they were rebooting their system and couldn't check me in. I had to wait a while. The lady felt bad and said she would just charge me for one night of parking since I had to wait so long. That saved us $26. The room was nice and surprisingly clean. The girls went back to sleep surprisingly well. We finally got to bed by 4:30 a.m. Cali time. That's 7:30 a.m. Georgia time &amp; Nate would already be at work &amp; Kenzie in school. We all just pulled an all nighter. Went to bed without brushing teeth &amp; and I didn't even take out my contacts.</p>
<p>First morning I woke up at 8 a.m. here. My body just couldn't sleep past that since it would have been 11 a.m. in Georgia. Plus I could hear the traffic from our room and that also woke me up. Everyone else slept in till almost 9:30 a.m. Here's to a fun start of the trip. Creating memories.</p>

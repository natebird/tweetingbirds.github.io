				This was our first family vacation with just us 4 Birds. Get ready for Disney pictures galore. I took over 1,100 pictures. The kids loved Magic Kingdom the best. It had the most rides and attractions for them. It was magical. We were there 3 of the 6 days. We even stayed late one of the night for the Electrical parade. Didn't quite make it for the fireworks, but we did watch it on the ferry on the way back to the parking lot. We have a ton of Magic Kingdom, so I'm making it two posts. I love that Nate's faces seemed so excited to be at Disney. And to think he was the one who was skeptical about the whole trip.</p>
<p>This was one excited little girl. Cinderella's castle was everything she dreamed of and more.</p>

<p>Those were the coolest balloons. We didn't get one, but we did enjoy looking at them. And I had one keep hitting me in the face from a little girl that stood next to me during the parade.</p>

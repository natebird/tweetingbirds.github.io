				How great is it to have a child that is so independent and obedient that she does most of my mommy work for me? I'll tell you.</p>
<p>Today, Kenzie and I went shopping at Target and Bath and Body Works looking for things for YW. Of course, being in the stores, she saw a plethora of wonderful things she would like to buy and take home. I let her play with things to keep her entertained in the shopping cart, but I clear out all the unnecessary things before I check out. Kenzie is usually OK with me putting the things back. The only explanation she needs is, "That has to stay at the store." No tears, no tantrums. Just an, "OK, mom." But today, she even said, "We need to put that back."</p>
<p>When we got home from shopping, it took a bit longer than I had anticipated as always, I fed her some lunch. I could tell she was antsy to get some playing time in with her princesses. I told her she can have a few minutes to play while I finished up my lunch. But then it would be nap time afterwards. She agreed. To my surprise, about 15 minutes later, Kenzie came up to me and announced, "The princesses are tired and it's my nap time, too." With two of her princesses in hand, she headed up the stairs herself.</p>
<p>That's nice.		</p>

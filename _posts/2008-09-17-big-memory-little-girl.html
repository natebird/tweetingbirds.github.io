				I am sitting upstairs in our office loft checking my emails and friends' blogs. Downstairs, Kenzie is watching one of her favorite shows, Super Why. This morning, her favorite Super Why episode is on, "Jack and the Beanstalk." I can hear her down there reciting parts of the show because she has seen that episode at least 20 times.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SNEiKeNz38I/AAAAAAAACjg/SJin35cV77c/s1600-h/characters.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/characters.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5247012604168363970" /></a><br />I came to the conclusion long ago that Kenzie knows so much because she absorbs everything and stores it in her memory. She memorizes books, song lyrics, TV shows, people's names, where things are placed around the house, and so forth. She can tell you where everything goes in the kitchen. She remember things we did several days ago - she is still talking about the shot she got from the doctor's office last Monday. This is how she learned to read the alphabet capital letters before she turned 18 months (now she's working on learning the lowercase letters). This is also how she is able to identify her books by looking only at the spine of the book on her bookshelves. She can't read the titles written on the spine of the books; she identifies it by the colors and the designs.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SNEfgE2S-NI/AAAAAAAACjQ/kuBh7-c_L1w/s1600-h/IMG_9087.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9087.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5247009676781091026" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SNEfgdWyj6I/AAAAAAAACjY/IcdT42Q7pAc/s1600-h/IMG_9092.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9092.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5247009683359829922" /></a><br />Her trick to storing knowledge in her long term memory: repetition. She will ask to listen to a song over and over again on repeat. She asks us to read the same book two or three times a day everyday for about two weeks until she can recite the book herself. She wants to watch the same show or movie many times.		</p>

<p>Winter Olympics 2002. My freshman year of college. My friends and I waited out in the cold out by Heritage Halls to see the Olympic Torch pass through BYU. It was a fun way to get into the Olympic spirit. People lined up on both sides of the streets as if they were watching a parade. Olympic sponsors driving by throwing out freebies, little flags to wave around. And freezing Utah weather. It was also fun to watch a mock torch barer run through the streets with a couple of his buddies all dressed in one piece thermos.		</p>

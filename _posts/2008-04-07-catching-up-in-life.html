				It has been the usual around our household as we head into April. We had a wonderful weekend watching General Conference with our new prophet, President Thomas S. Monson. I am excited about all the new apostles and the new First Presidency. Kenzie also had a wonderful time playing with her cousin, Mia, over conference weekend as we watched it at her house.</p>
<p>Last night I was on the phone with a friend and Kenzie decided to mimic me talking on the phone by pretending the iPod was her phone. I was using my right shoulder to hold my cell phone as I used both hands to clean the kitchen. When Kenzie saw that, she tucked the iPod between her tilted head and her shoulder to be just like mom. She then proceeded to tell the iPod all about her day with words such as Mimi's house (she calls Mia, Mimi), playing Rocky (their dog), Stacey (auntie), Scott (uncle), and Sammie (Mia's brother). Nate was laughing hysterically as he watched Kenzie and I do the exact same things at the same time.</p>
<p>Another funny moment this weekend, I wasn't there to witness it, but this was how Nate told it to me. Kenzie loves strawberries (she pronounces it s-da-bees). When we were at my uncle Scott's house to watch conference, I had brought over a fruit plate of grapes and strawberries with chocolate dip. Scott was at the table dipping some strawberries into the chocolate for him to eat and Kenzie said "s-da-bees!" pointing to Scott. Scott thought Kenzie said diabetes which amazed him and said, "Wow! How did she know?!"</p>

<p>We have been having strawberry smoothies with the warm weather. Kenzie starts out sharing one with dad.</p>

<p>Kenzie like to stand up her sidewalk chalks and pretend they are candles. We sing Happy Birthday and blow out all 20 candles.</p>

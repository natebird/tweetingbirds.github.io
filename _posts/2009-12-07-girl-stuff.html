				Kenzie opened the bottle of nail polish remove and manages to spill some on the carpet.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, I spilt some on the carpet. But I was cleaning it up all by myself with my hands.<br />Tiffany: Thanks for cleaning up the mess.<br />Kenzie: You're welcome. Are you mad?<br />Tiffany: No, I'm not mad.<br />Kenzie: Good. Because accidents happen.</p>
<p>I have been working on getting Kenzie to be more independent and do thing herself.		</p>

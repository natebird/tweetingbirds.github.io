				This was told to me by our friend Barron who was substituting Kenzie's primary Sunbeam class. The lesson was on animals (creation of the earth). Barron asked the kids to name animals that they can draw on the blackboard. After a while, the kids ran out of animals.</p>
<p>Kenzie: I know! We can draw nocturnal animals!<br />[Blank stares from the other kids in the class]<br />Barron: Nocturnal animals. What are those?<br />Kenzie: Animals that come out at night.<br />Barron: Can you name some nocturnal animals?<br />Kenzie: Opossums, bats, raccoonsâ€¦</p>
<p>Smarty pants.</p>
<p>Also, today the primary president told me that Kenzie is the only Sunbeam she has ever seen who actually sings all the words to the primary songs they do in singing time. And she sings it loud enough for them to hear her.</p>
<p>Atta girl!		</p>

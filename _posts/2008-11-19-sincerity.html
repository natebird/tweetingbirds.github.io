				<span style="font-weight:bold;">Warning: This may sound like a negative post at first, but it has a sweet ending. I promise.</span></p>
<p>I have been having some trouble getting Kenzie to eat her meals. She has some days where she does really well (sits at the table and eats the food we put in front of her). But most of the days lately has been a struggle, especially at dinner time. I'm sure this is a challenge for many mothers with toddlers. I'm concerned with the amount of calories Kenzie actually receives each day because she is under weight for her age. At the same time, I don't want to stuff her full of junk food just for calorie sake.</p>
<p>The main problem at meal times is she gets to involved with playing that she doesn't want to take the time to sit at the table and eat. Later on, she will complain of hunger, but wants snacks rather than a meal. I've got myself a snacker here. She will snack all day long if I let her. So I have been trying to teach her that her toys will wait for her to eat her meals. And when it's bed time, she will delay bedtime rituals by saying she is hungry.</p>
<p>After several different attempts through several different approaches, I finally decided to go with the you-have-to-sit-at-the-table-until-you-eat tactic. I've used the tactic a couple times before and it worked pretty well with some reasoning.</p>
<p>Then tonight, Kenzie really put up a fight. She cried and pitched a fit. Didn't even want to eat one bite of beef stroganoff. We told her that she had to eat her dinner before getting down from her seat. More crying and rejection of the food. Nate and I ate our dinner, finished, and I did the dishes, all the while ignoring her. Finally, I went to the table and sat her on my lap. I asked her if she was ready to eat her dinner and she said yes. Then she gave me a hug and said, "Mommy, I'm very sorry." She apologized all on her own. Her sincerity brought me to tears. What a sweet girl. She is like her daddy, always the first to apologize.		</p>

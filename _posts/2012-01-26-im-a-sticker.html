				I have been wanting to purchase some custom stickers ever since Moo.com came out with it a while ago. But I never knew what to put on the stickers. Then as I was making a bunch of crafts for people during the holidays, I realized I could so something that says "made by Tiffany". So that's what I did. And now I can make things look a little nicer and personalized when I make things for people. The stickers turned out really nice. Great print quality and it looks professional. I love them!</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">Since birth Kenzie has been learning something new each day. This Christmas season has been extra fun for both Nate and me as we teach Kenzie all the fun stuff about Christmas. This is what she has learned so far:</div>
<div>
<ol>
<li>Santa (or "Ta" to Kenzie right now) says, "Ho! Ho! Ho!"</li>
<li>Snowmen are her best friends! And when she sees one, she will put her hands together to do the motion to the Primary song, "Once There was a Snowman." If someone mentions the word "snowman" in our house, she will point to her snowman Christmas stocking she picked out herself.</li>
<li>Kenzie knows that Christmas trees are poky and should not be touched. When we were putting up our fake Christmas tree that Nate and I bought back when we were dating (it's a long story), Kenzie wanted to help. That was until she actually touched one of the branches and she didn't like to fake pine needles poking her. Today, I read Kenzie a Christmas book and in the book she saw a drawing of a Christmas tree. She touched the drawing of the tree then quickly pulled back and said, "Ouch!"<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R2hwnutV1yI/AAAAAAAAA0Y/WlJxs7V9-zM/s1600-h/tree.jpg"><img style="float:right; margin:0 0 10px 10px;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/tree.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5145486402126206754" /></a></li>
<li>Although the tree has many tempting ornaments and pretty lights to allure her it, Nate spent 5 minutes teaching Kenzie not to pull the ornaments off the tree. Thanks, Nate! That saved me hours of picking up ornaments and putting it back on the tree.</li>
<li>Kenzie is now old enough to understand presents and the art of gift giving. We let her open one of her gifts from her Grandma because it had a Christmas ornament, a Christmas toy, a Rudolph coloring book, and a stuffed snowman. She had so much fun opening the gift and then she put her old toys back in the gift bag and gave it to her dad to open. </li>
</ol>

				The other week I received an email from the associate producer of the Martha Stewart Show. They somehow came to Simply Modern Mom and liked the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/kenzies-ice-cream-party/" target="_blank">ice cream pi√±ata</a> tutorial I did for Kenzie's birthday party last year. They are interested in putting me on the show. But first they wanted to make sure I'm "show worthy". So I had to do a short intro video of myself just telling them what I do and such. So those that know me knows that I'm not the "in-front-of-camera" type person. I do not like to be in videos and barely in photos. First I had to overcome the stomach bug before I could do a video of myself. One day while Nate was at work, I set up the tripod and my camera and shot a short video of myself in my room while the kids were downstairs watching TV.</p>
<p>Thanks to my <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/02/my-first-video-job/" target="_blank">recent video training</a>, I didn't do too bad. I felt a little more comfortable being in front of a camera. But I still hate watching myself in videos. I'm so awkward in videos. So we'll see how this goes. Unfortunately, since Martha Stewart's show is so big, they don't fly or pay for accommodations for their guests unless they are celebrities. So if I do get chosen to go on the show, I would have to hitch my own ride. Which I would totally figure out a way to get there since this is a once in a life time opportunity! Plus who can say no to Martha Stewart?!		</p>

				The other night, Kenzie went to the bathroom by herself in the middle of the night. Nate and I didn't know she even got up and out of bed until the next morning when we passed her room and her bedroom door was open with her still sleeping. It's usually closed.</p>
<p>This is an accomplishment because Kenzie, when she needed to go to the potty in the middle of the night, would usually stay in her bed and call out, "I need to go potty!" until we wake up and take her. She knows how to go to the potty herself, it was like she was waiting for permission. Nice now that she can do it without an announcement and more importantly without disrupting our sleep.</p>
<p>Nate asked her that morningâ€¦</p>
<p><b>Nate:</b> Did you get up in the middle of the night?<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> Yes, so I can go potty by myself.<br /><b>Nate:</b> That's good. Laney was up at 6 this morning. That's very early.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> I was up at 3. [she can't tell time, so that wasn't the exact time]<br /><b>Nate:</b> It's not supposed to be a contest to see who can wake up the earliest.		</p>

				Ah. You think the third time around I would be a pro at being pregnant. Nope. For me, being pregnant is the hardest part about having a baby. It's 9 months of being uncomfortable! Before I would get pregnant the second time I had to get to a point where I kinda forgot what it was like to be pregnant and OK with doing that to my body again. It was a surreal, out-of-body experience to watch your body grow so big so quickly.</p>
<p>I would like to think I have become more graceful with each pregnancy. The first one was just bad and ugly. I gained 45 pounds and birthed a 9 pound 2 ounce baby. I worked as a pharmacy tech until three weeks before Kenzie was born. It was through the humid summer and I was on my feet 40 hours a week filling prescriptions. I blew up. Customers at the pharmacy were asking me if I was having twins. Yuck. The second time around it was a little better. I only gained 35 pounds and birthed a 7 pounds 12 ounce baby. She was a winter baby so I didn't have to suffer through the horrible summer. I think that helped.</p>
<p>I am currently at 17 weeks (4 months, second trimester). Here are some info about my 3rd pregnancy, just for me to remember…</p>
<ul>
<li>I have been sick. Nausea all day. But not as bad as it was with Kenzie but not as easy as it was with Laney. So this one is somewhere in between. And like my pregnancy with Kenzie, it has taken about 4 months to be over the sickness.</li>
<li>Smells galore. I can smell everything and that has made me really sick. It still bugs me but at least I don't gag as much as I used to the last few months.</li>
<li>I've been sick with a head cold, stomach flu and some air born allergies now that it's going into spring. All within the first 3 months of pregnancy.</li>
<li>I am still wearing my regular clothes, pants and jeans. I just can't button my jeans so I use a head band to hold the button together. Not looking forward to maternity clothes. Haven't pulled those out yet.</li>
<li>I've only thrown up once, that was when I had the stomach flu. But sometimes I would rather puke than to feel nauseated all day.</li>
<li>I have an aversion to garlic, onions, broccoli, green beans, ginger, Italian food, some Mexican food and anything that's seasoned really strong.</li>
<li>I've been craving fruits, salad (with thousand island dressing only), boiled eggs (except I'm not found of the smell, weird), potato foods, oatmeal or cream of wheat (for breakfast) and my most current craving is beef jerky.</li>
<li>Hate to say this but I've been having digestion problems (just gas) and apparently the doctor said it's quite common in pregnancies. This is the first time it has happened to me. But the OB said my body has slowed down digestion so the baby can absorb the foods better and that can cause gas. So not lady-like!</li>
<li>I've also had problems to burping. Yuck. I don't like to eat food because of that. It makes me sick. Tums has helped with that a bit.</li>
<li>I am extremely tired all the time. I have days when I have more energy than others but even then, I want to be in bed by 8:30 each night. And this also means I'm grumpy and impatient. Mama needs her rest!</li>
<li>This baby is sucking all my brain power. This happened with the other two kids too. I've been so forgetful and spacey lately. I'm forgetting names and words that I use all the time. And haven't had the motivation to do any crafting. Sad.</li>
<li>I'm four months in and still haven't really gained any weight yet. I do have a little belly pouch though. So I'm not sure where the weight is going. I'm fine with that since I'll probably blow up this summer in the heat. Not looking forward to that. At my first OB appointment I had gained 1 pound. Then at my second appointment I lost 2 pounds, but that's right after I had the stomach flu. So we'll see what my next appointment is like. I've been eating little more food now.</li>
<li>We'll find out the gender at my next appointment, April 5. Hopefully this kid will show us his/her goodies. Kenzie was modest and had her legs crossed. We had to wait another month to find out the gender!</li>
<li>I've been emotional about everything. I've been good to keep it to myself this time. The other two times Nate was like, "What the heck happened to my wife?!" I cry about everything with all the extra hormones going through my body.</li>
<li>Our kids will be 2 1/2 years apart each. Yes, we planned it that way. Just didn't expect it to be so exact. This will be our second August baby. We've been blessed to be able to get pregnant quickly (Laney was the longest and I think it was about 4 months to get pregnant with her). That is such a blessing when I have so many friends who has had or is having a hard time conceiving.</li>
<li>Kenzie has been hoping it's a girl and came up with names for the baby… Emma and Daisy. Nate and I are not fans of either names. We're hoping (I think more so me than Nate, although he wouldn't mind having another girl) for another girl. Haven't even began to think of names yet. We'll worry about that whenever we find out the gender.</li>
<li>For the past few weeks I've been feeling the baby move and kick at least once a day. It's my daily confirmation that the baby is OK.</li>
</ul>

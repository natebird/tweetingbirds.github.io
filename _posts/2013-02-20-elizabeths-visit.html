				Elizabeth and I have been friends since high school. People at school always thought we were sisters. She was in the grade below. We were friends at church too. She lives in Utah now with her husband and two boys and a dog. She came back to visit her family in September. She came over with her two boys for a little play date at our house then we all went out for ice cream. It was so fun to catch up with life and see how she is doing. We love it when friends come to visit.</p>

				I took Kenz in yesterday for her 2-year wellness checkup. She had been fighting a gray fever since Friday evening. Nate stayed home with her all day Sunday while I went to church solo. And she finally broke her fever during her nap Sunday afternoon. It wasn't much of a cold because she didn't have sinus problems other than losing her voice. She thought that was pretty cool, she said, "Mommy, I lost my voice like Ariel!"</p>
<p>Kenz's checkup went well. I love her pediatrician. He is so good with her. He was extremely impressed with her communication abilities. She made him laugh a few times with the stuff she said. As he was checking her, he noticed her flexibility. He said she can bend and stretch more than most kids her age and suggested she may want to be a gymnast. He also said she is ready to be potty trainedâ€¦ I'm not sure I'm ready for it.</p>
<p>On the doctor's office growth, development, and learning chart Kenzie's communication skills is at the level of a 4-year-old. Everything else she is at par or just a little ahead. She measured in the 75th-90th percentile for her height and 10th percentile for weight.</p>
<p>Everything went well until her flu nasal spray (instead of the shot, this is something new this year) and Hep A shot. But the nurse gave her some Tylenol and a Princess Belle sticker and she left with a smile on her face.		</p>

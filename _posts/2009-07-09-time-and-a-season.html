<p>I launched my <a href="http://simplymodernmom.wordpress.com">Simply Modern Mom</a> blog last week as a place to collaborate ideas and record my projects I am often working on. Launch week was crazy… setting up a blog, claiming the name on major social network sites, trying out Twitter, designing a logo, writing posts, marketing the site to readers, attempting to get my foot in the door of the sewing/crafting community, and so forth.
<div></div>
<div>It was a lot of stress on top of this blog, mommy duties, wife duties, and church duties. I also have a ton of projects I am trying to get to. Not to mention, <i>So You Think You Can Dance</i> takes up 3 hours of my week. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I looked at other super moms and realized I can't ever be one of them. I am in awe wondering how do they keep up with it all? Because I actually said these words to Nate last week:</div>
<div></div>
<blockquote><div>"I haven't looked at my to-do list all week because I've been trying to get all the things done that didn't even make it on my to-do list."<br />

<blockquote>"I find myself throwing Kenzie in front of the TV so I can try to get my things done. And I always said I wouldn't be one of those moms who uses the TV as the babysitter."</p></blockquote>
</div>
<div>
<blockquote>"I think I have come to the conclusion that maybe this isn't the time for me to do all… I mean everything."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"I am a mom who is trying to do everything and failing miserably at it."</p></blockquote>
<blockquote><p>"I think I am trying to do too much when I can't even remember the last time I showered. Not only am I not exercising, I'm now neglecting personal hygiene." </p></blockquote>
<p>I am so grateful for patient kids and husband who supports me in my crazy ideas. Then comforts me when I come to my senses and realize I am doing too much. </p></div>

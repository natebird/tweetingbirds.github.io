				I'm embarrassed. Nate is so proud. I guess I'm now categorized as a professional blogger. I feel so nerdy saying I'm a blogger. But it puts a huge grin on Nate's face. He loves the fact that I am doing something totally in his realm of expertise (not blogging but techie stuff).</p>
<p>I am going to try to do my best to keep up with this blog. Both girls are growing up so fast that I want to keep a record of it for journaling sake. And I try to keep personal stuff off Simply Modern Mom. So don't forego this blog just yet. I'll be around. I'll just have to get really good at scheduling posts.</p>
<p>Simply Modern Mom has really taken off and I'm so surprised by where it is right now. This past week, I reached over 1,000 followers on email or RSS feed (people who subscribe to SMM and read it in email or RSS reader). I am also getting about 1,000 visitors to my site (actual clicks to SMM web page) a day. That comes to about 2,000 page views a day. I still pinch myself because I can't believe that many people care about what I have to write about. Ha!</p>
<p>Also, I guess most of you probably heard that I was featured on KSL Studio 5. It's a lifestyle TV show in Utah (like Good Morning America but only in Utah). They had me do a phone interview about Project 52: Date Night. The dating project on SMM. Kind of crazy, huh?</p>
<p>It has been a lot of work and continues to be endless hours of work toward the website. I estimated probably 30 hours a week working on SMM, writing, answering emails, responding to comments, guest posting for other sites, photography, marketing, PR, photo editing, coming up with ideas and making it work (crafts), then doing tutorials, etc.</p>
<p>OK, I'm going to stop talking about SMM right now and get back to the important stuffâ€¦ My kids. :)		</p>

				A few Mondays ago, Kenzie gave our FHE lesson. She gave us the lesson she learned from her primary class. Her teacher, Sis. Harman, taught a lesson about the church being restored on the earth. And Kenzie gave us her entire lesson at FHE, including her object lesson on what <em>restored</em> means.</p>
<p>"Sis. Harman had a little deer that was yellow. It looked like Rudolph the Red Nose Reindeer. She showed it to us. Then she put it behind our back where we couldn't see it. Then she restored it so we can see it again."		</p>

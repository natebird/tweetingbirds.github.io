				Kenzie has had a love for dogs and puppies since before she was a year old. She still holds a special place for them in her heart. But now her new best friend is no longer her stuffed puppy, Ruff Ruffman. It's now my old Hello Kitty. It's a doll I've had since I was about 6. My mom found it in her attic a few month ago and returned it to me. It sat in Kenzie's room, but she paid no attention to it until just recently. We leave it at home when we go places because it's quite large. But as soon as we walk into the door, she said, "Meow." Calling for her Hello Kitty. Almost the same size as Kenzie, she loves to carry it around the house and have dance time with it. She also learned to wrestle with the cat, mounting herself on top of the cat and bouncing. A great reason why we don't have real pets.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R3AJmOtV13I/AAAAAAAAA1A/ykgqUPohWtw/s1600-h/IMG_6957.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6957.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5147624926472427378" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R3AJmOtV14I/AAAAAAAAA1I/8bjf920rDZM/s1600-h/IMG_6982.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6982.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5147624926472427394" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R3AJmOtV15I/AAAAAAAAA1Q/W12-09c8jPQ/s1600-h/IMG_6987.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6987.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5147624926472427410" /></a>		</p>

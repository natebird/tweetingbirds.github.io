<ul>
<li>She gets cuter every day. Not sure how it happens, but she does.</li>
<li>Her top two i-teeth came in. The bottom two are on their way. She has 14 teeth now. When the bottom ones come in that will be 16.</li>
<li>She is still a mommy's girl. Quite clingy, actually. I don't mind because it won't always be like this.</li>
<li>She is warming up to Nate more. She gets excited when he comes home from work and hear the garage door. She runs to the door yelling, "Dad! Dad!"</li>
<li>She wants to feed herself now using utensils. She is actually quite well at it. She refuses to wear a bib, which is unfortunate for her clothes.</li>
<li>Her favorite book is "Piggies" by Audrey Wood. We read it every night. Her favorite song is <em>Twinkle, Twinkle Little Star</em>.</li>
<li>She loves to dance. When she hears a good beat she knows how to groove.</li>
<li>She loves to accessorize, like her sisters. She loves to wear her sister's shoes. And then she'll wear necklaces, bracelets and sunglasses.</li>
<li>She says shoes, cheese, mom, dad, done, ball, baby, all gone, snack, Puo Puo, Dudepa, hi, bye, burr (cold), hot, nose, ruff ruff (dog), more, quack (duck), teeth, moo (cow), chips.</li>
<li>If I tell her in a serious tone, No, on something she is doing wrong, she feels remorseful and cries that she did something wrong.</li>
<li>She's a good helper and loves to help me. She throws away her diapers. She puts things in the trash. She picks up toys and put things away.</li>
<li>She loves her sisters and love playing with them. She is also good at taking thing away from them. She will fight to get something back.</li>
<li>She takes just one nap a day now for about 2 hours.</li>
<li>She loves babies and dogs (not real ones though, they scare her).</li>
</ul>

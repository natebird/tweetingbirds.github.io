				Thanks Lisa for tagging me... again! That's three in one week. But I still love you, Lisa! Sorry for all the info about me. You now probably know more than you ever wanted.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">What I was doing 10 years ago...</span></span><br />I was 14 years old and just moved to Georgia from Hawaii. I hated being in Georgia and leaving all my friends in Hawaii. I couldn't understand what people were saying with their Southern draw. I was in the small Cartersville Ward before it split into Cartersville and Cassville wards and before it became a stake. I was best friends with my cousin, Joycelyn, we did everything together, even went to the same high school. I missed Hawaii a lot. And this was also my freshman year in high school, the year before I got some fashion sense knocked into me.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">5 Things on my "To-Do" list today...</span></span><br />1. Go to the Chinese New Year Festival with my family and my parents.<br />2. Gather stuff for church tomorrow, including Kenzie's church bag.<br />3. Decide something to make for dessert tomorrow for dessert night with some friends.<br />4. Balance check book.<br />5. Wish Natalie a happy birthday.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">3 Bad habits I have...</span></span><br />1. I like to sleep in. I wake up whenever Kenzie wakes up, around 9ish.<br />2. I edit everything I read as I am reading it.<br />3. I can be too OCD about being clean and organized.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">Places I have lived...</span></span><br />Taipei, Taiwan; Laie, Hawaii; Adairsville, Georgia; Cartersville, Georgia; Westbury, New York; Orem, Utah; Provo, Utah.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 153);">Things most people don't know about me...</span></span><br />I was baptized when I was 9 at Temple Beach in Hawaii in December. Since it was at a beach on a Saturday, we had to have the baptism way early, before the beach goers came out.		</p>

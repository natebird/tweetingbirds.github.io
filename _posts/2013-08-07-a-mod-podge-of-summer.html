				We had quite the summer. It went by much too quickly but we had lots of fun. Here's a run down of what we did.</p>
<p>We went to the mall and rode the carousel. I had to go get a new iPhone (still under warranty, thankfully) because the camera stopped working on the old phone. This is my third iPhone 5 because of malware. Thank goodness for warranty, right?</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7437" alt="130610_00001" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130610_00001.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7438" alt="130610_00002" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130610_00002.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>The three girls spent a lot of time together this summer. They learned to get along among all the fighting and crying. They have learned to play together. I love my girls.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7439" alt="130611_00003" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130611_00003.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>We went to the library a couple times. One time we saw a magic show by the Tooth Fairy. The girls loved it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7440" alt="130612_00004" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130612_00004.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>More sister loves. It makes me smiles.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7441" alt="130614_00005" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130614_00005.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>On Father's Day Nate spent some time making a slide down the stairs. Endless fun.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7442" alt="130616_00006" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130616_00006.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Lai Lai's personality is really coming out and she is quite fun. She has her own styles and she is just a hoot. She is funny and quite the joker.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7443" alt="130617_00007" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130617_00007.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>We had to say good bye to some really good friends who moved to Kentucky. So sad. We lost our monthly game night buddies.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7444" alt="130620_00001" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130620_00001.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>We went out to the playground with my girls. They dress up even for the park.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7445" alt="130620_00008" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130620_00008.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>Survived through 17 swim lessons. This girl was kept happy during all that time with fruit snacks and occasional suckers. Look at that face. She was so proud of herself for finding it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7446" alt="130625_00002" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130625_00002.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>She's an omnivore, alright. That turkey leg. She didn't eat the whole thing. She was just gnawing on the bones.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7447" alt="130626_00003" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130626_00003.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>We went to the movies a couple times. The girls watched Monsters University and Ice Age.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7448" alt="130627_00004" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130627_00004.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>We fixed our front yard. Had to put new sod in. The girls were good help and loved the sand.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7451" alt="130525_00001" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130525_00001.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>And more pictures of Lai Lai's personality. She put a bag over her head walking around the house like that. She thought she was so funny. What a girl! Love it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7452" alt="130702_00001" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130702_00001.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7453" alt="130702_00002" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130702_00002.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>Nate has been working a lot this summer, especially in July. He has been getting home late, right before the girls go to bed. And he's gone before they wake up. A few times they see him through video chat. The poor guy just passes out when he comes home. This was a picture of him when he fell asleep at 8:30.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7454" alt="130703_00003" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130703_00003.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>And when he is home, he does things like this. Help the girls build a paper castle that took an hour and half.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7455" alt="130705_00004" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130705_00004.jpg" width="450" height="600" /></p>
<p>There are some cute girls! She loves her big sisters.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-7456" alt="130721_00005" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/130721_00005.jpg" width="600" height="450" />		</p>

				My cousin, Philip, had showed me these crochet beard hats on Etsy before Christmas. He thought they were the coolest things. He wanted one. Well, his parents bought him one for Christmas. He wore it to our family Christmas gathering. Philip's wife is expecting their third baby and it's a boy. I missed her baby shower because it was the same time that Lai LaiÂ had her RSV and bronchitis. But I did make little versions of the beard hat for their little boy. They thought that was pretty funny. I purchased the crochet pattern from Etsy. The first one I made was the one that Laney is wearing. So I made a second one that was more infant baby size. I gave them both so he can have something to wear as a baby and then grow into the second one. I can't wait to see this baby in the beard hat. Hilarious.</p>

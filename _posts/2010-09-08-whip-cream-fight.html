<p>In the middle of all the festivities on Saturday, we took a break to have a whip cream fight. Aren't the Birds the coolest family in the world?! I am so luck to have married into such a spectacular family. They are so much fun. Laney was napping. Kenzie wanted to participate until we told her she would get dirty. Then she changed her mind. She's not the get dirty type of girl. I was the photographer and sat out with Jessica (Nick's wife). One of Michelle's friend, Lindsey, came over to join in on the fight.</p>
<p>It started with everyone running to the middle to grab a can of whip cream.</p>

<p>Then it got crazyâ€¦ whip cream everywhere.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1732" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-6-the-wedding/img_6133/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1732" title="IMG_6133 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6133.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Nate getting his mom smack in the face.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1734" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-6-the-wedding/img_6160-1-2/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1734" title="IMG_6160-(1) *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6160-11.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="403" /></a></p>
<p>Then getting his sister Nicole. He's such a nice elder brother.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1735" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-6-the-wedding/img_6295/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1735" title="IMG_6295 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6295.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="404" /></a></p>
<p>Everyone ganging up on Randy and spiking his hair.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1738" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-6-the-wedding/img_6347/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1738" title="IMG_6347 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6347.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Then the hose down. Good thing they had 3 showers in their house and two water heaters.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1739" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-6-the-wedding/img_6394/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1739" title="IMG_6394 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6394.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>Kenzie enjoyed eating whip cream off her hands.</p>

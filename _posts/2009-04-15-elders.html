Congratulations to Nate's twin brothers, Mitchell and Michael, who both got their mission calls on separate days last week. Mitchell will be going to the Honduras San Pedro Sula Mission and Michael will be going to the Chile Concepcion Mission. They both report June 24 to the Provo MTC. </p>
<p>Nate will have FOUR siblings out on missions from June until October when his brother Matt returns from the Texas Dallas Mission. The other sibling, Nicole, is in the China Hong Kong Mission. We love our missionaries!		</p>

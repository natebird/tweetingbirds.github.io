<p>It took a week after the painting was finished to get the girls sleeping in their room. It took that long to air out the paint smells. The bunk bed had the worst smell. We had the windows opened in the room for a week and that didn't work well enough. So we researched online and people were saying to cut up onion, put it in a bowl over night and that would take care of the smell. We were desperate to get the girls in the room and get our lives back in order. So we decided to try that. Ew. The entire house was stinking, smelling like Burger King. Yuck. And it didn't help that I've been having a <strong><em>strong</em></strong> aversion to onions and garlic this pregnancy. So I was ready to puke at any time. The worst part was we don't even think worked.</p>
<p>Laney beat me to it though. She puked first with the stomach bug she had. It got everywhere and Nate had to call the carpet cleaning guy to come clean it because it was that bad. We also had him clean the girls' new room so that helped a bit with the smell. Then I installed two Wallflowers (from Bath and Body Works) in their room. That's helped a bit too.</p>
<p>Also during this time, we were trying to find affordable bedding that matched the girls' room for the bunk beds. It is ridiculous how expensive bedding cost for beds. I didn't want anything with cartoons or birds or owls or any type of characters on it. Not my style. I found something that I loved online at <a href="http://www.serenaandlily.com/Bedding/Duvets-Tess-Duvet" target="_blank">Serena &amp; Lily but it was $180 for the duvet cover per twin bed</a>. Sheesh. I wasn't about to pay more for the bedding than I did on the bunk bed itself! But I found at Target a similar knock-off for a lot less. So we went with that. Although, the second night the girls slept in the bunk beds with their new pretty covers, Laney threw up again. We had to take everything off and wash it. Luckily for us, it was all machine washable. No way I would have bought dry clean only comforters.</p>

<p>Both girls have been doing well sleeping in their new beds. Kenzie loves being on the top bunk. Laney loves being in a big girl bed. This was the first time she had her own big girl bed and the adjustment from crib to bed went smoothly for Laney. The only down side to this is both girls are awake at 7:30-ish each morning. It doesn't matter what time they went to bed the night before. They wake each other up in the mornings. And sometimes they have a hard time falling asleep, only when one or both are not tired and they find excuses to get out of bed.</p>
<p>And now for quiet time, Kenzie goes into the guest room and plays or read in there while Laney takes a nap in their bedroom. It's been working out pretty well. Only one day when I had problem with Laney keep getting out of bed. That was also the day when she figured out how to open doors. Oh fun.</p>
<p>Overall it's been pretty smooth transition. We just need to get working on finishing the rest of the room. We've been having rainy and cold days lately where we're not able to paint outside. The girls are in love with their rooms though.		</p>

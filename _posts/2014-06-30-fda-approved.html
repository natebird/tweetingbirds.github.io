				While we were at our beach vacation Nate received a text from his boss that they received FDA approval for their medical device! What they have been waiting for for over 10 years, although Nate has only been with the company the last couple years. It was exciting news. But there are also going to be a lot of changes. As soon as FDA approval went through, they were bought out by St. Jude Medical. That was in the works for years because St. Jude was a huge investor into the device. So there's a lot of transitioning happening right now. </p>
<p>Nate went out to WWDC for a week in San Francisco. He had a great time. Luckily his work paid for it. All of it. It was super expensive just to get into the conference. Then he went from there to Michelle's funeral in Utah. He was going to go back to Washington with is mom to help her out. But he decided to come home because he was going to leave for LA again for work. He went out to Los Angeles to meet with St. Jude and work out some web stuff. He's been gone a lot this June. And we though this summer was going to be calm and easy. Ha! </p>
<p>One of the weeks when he was home, his work had a big banquet celebrating FDA approval and the acquisition of the company. We went and brought Nora with us since I had to nurse her while we were gone and she's too young for me to leave with the babysitter. I bought a new dress for the event. It was a cocktail attire. There are no cocktail attire that's nursing friendly. So I bought one that kinda worked with me doing some contortionist act to get to a point where I can nurse Nora. I practiced a few times at home. </p>
<p>It was a fun night. We had a babysitter for the other three girls. We got all dressed up and went into town for the nice banquet at a uptown hotel. It was a buffet catered dinner with such yummy food. They had a sushi bar! Too bad I was nursing and couldn't eat sushi. Ugh. Nora was good most of the time. Then she was way too tired and just kept crying for a long time. I nursed her in the bathroom and she still didn't stop crying. She finally fell asleep as we were leaving. </p>
<p>It was impressive to see the people working at CardioMEMS. They are all really passionate about the product and so happy it see it go through FDA. They actually did a few implants patients that were so excited to have that. It is something that will save their lives. And the American Heart Association was also there to tell them how excited they were to have this product out to help save lives. It was pretty cool to be there and be a part of this celebration.And just nice to have a date night with Nate. </p>

				I did the laundry and had left a pile of little girls panties on our bed as I folded the rest of the clothes. The two older girls thought it would be fun to take the pile of panties and toss it in the air like it was raining panties. Then Kenzie grabbed a bunch of panties turned to Nate and asked, "Dad, would you like to play a game of panties basketball?"</p>
<p>Nate couldn't help but laugh then responded, "You know, in high school I would have thought the game sounded intriguing. But nowâ€¦ Not so much."		</p>

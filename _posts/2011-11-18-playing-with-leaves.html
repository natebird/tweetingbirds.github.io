				This is totally my Laney Balaney. Having a grand ol' time. I am taking another online photography class. And I'm putting things I am learning to use. It's a class taught by a professional photographer who is also a blogger name Aimee. I met her when I went to North Carolina to the the Samsung video shoot. She was teaching a 3 week online photography class and it was only $39 (I know! So cheap for a photography class!) so I thought I would do it. It never hurts to learn more. And these pictures turned out pretty well. These are unedited.</p>

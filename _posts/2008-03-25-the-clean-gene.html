<p>
				I have passed down the clean gene to my daughter who often tells me when something is dirty -- her hands, my shirt, her clothes, the table, the kitchen floor, the living room carpet, the couch, and so forth. I hear her say that word several time a day. If she gets something on her hand while eating, she says, "Uh oh," as she holds out her hand for us to wipe. She will tell us when she has a stinky diaper by saying, "Poop" or "I pooped." She will pick little stuff and lint off the carpet all the time and hand it to me. When I'm in the kitchen cooking, she likes to either help me cook or take out the rags and mop the kitchen floor.</p>
<p>Although, lately she has been getting her toys all over the floor and not picking it up. The past few days I have been trying to get her to help me pick up her mess, teach her to clean up after herself. I'll let you know how it goes. So far, not to bad. The pictures below shows Kenzie helping me sort through her out-grown baby clothes. She had a great time grabbing a bunch of clothes, tossing it in the air, and saying, "Woohoo! Happy!"</p>

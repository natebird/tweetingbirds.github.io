				Recently I've had a couple instances where I was able to talk to Barron's mom, Georgia, a little bit about the gospel. The first time was when we went over to her house in January to give them Barron's book that I made for the Smith family. We were able to talk a little bit about overcoming trials and the plan of salvation. Then more recently, she came with me, Irene, and Camille to the stake Relief Society birthday celebration brunch. Irene was speaking and she came to hear her speak. There were amazing talks by amazing women about overcoming tough trials in their lives. It was a very spiritual meeting. I got to talk to Georgia also about the church's initiative to help members be more self sufficient and food storage. 		</p>

				Kenzie has been asking all day for mom or dad to get her drums from the attic. No luck.</p>
<p>When she was playing with Laney, Laney pulled her hair.</p>
<p>Kenzie: [coming to mom and dad crying] Laney messed up my Mulan hair. She pulled it.<br />Tiffany: She didn't mean to. She is still learning.<br />Kenzie: Now I'm sad because she messed up my Mulan hair. I need you to get my drums from the attic so I can be happy again.<br />Tiffany: How about I just fix your hair?</p>
<p>Nate, the good dad, got her drums for her. She's happy again.		</p>

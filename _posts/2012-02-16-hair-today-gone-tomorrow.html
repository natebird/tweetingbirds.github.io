				Guess who decided to take little kid scissors and chop off her hair and her sister's hair? Luckily it was only a small piece of Kenzie's hair and it hides well. She was upstairs with Kenzie while Nate and I were downstairs. Laney came downstairs and I saw short pieces of hair sticking up on the top of her head. I knew exactly what happened. That little stinker.</p>

				People often say jet lag is hardest when you get homeâ€¦ I believe it! Yesterday Kenzie slept from 2 p.m. until midnight. We woke her up at around 6:15 p.m. to eat dinner, but she wasn't interested and was just dragging around, eventually falling asleep on the floor in the living room. And as Nate and I were trying to get off to dreamland, Kenzie was awake and ready to start her day.</p>
<p>Also at midnight, China Airlines called Nate's phone twice from San Francisco saying they found our car seat- yes, I haven't mentioned the lost car seat on our flight home. That story will come later.</p>
<p>Eventually, Nate got Kenzie out of bed as she was crying with the thunderstorm last night. She hung out in our bed laying around or watching Curious George on Nate's phone until around 4 a.m. Then she woke me up saying she was hungry. At that time, I left Nate to sleep since he had to work today. Kenzie and I went downstairs for some oatmeal. After the early morning breakfast, she was ready to play. I stayed up with Kenzie since she wouldn't let me go back to bed. We watched a little of Surf's Up and played with her My Little Ponies.</p>
<p>Then I decided to start loads of laundry since I was already up. And caught up on some emails. Around 8:30 a.m., I put Kenzie back down as she showed some signs of sleepiness. After putting her down, I finally got to bed around 10:30 a.m. and slept until 2 p.m.! Kenzie slept until I woke her up at 3:30 p.m. I didn't want her to sleep too late in hopes that she will go back to bed tonight and sleep through the night. Please, I'm tired!		</p>

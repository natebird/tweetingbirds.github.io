				Day 5 of Randy and Cyndi's visit we went to church. On the way home from church, we drove around some neighborhoods in our city to look at houses. And in the evening, we went over to my cousin, Philip and T'naiha's house for our monthly Family Home Evening with my extended family. We played a fun game of church Taboo and had yummy cupcakes.</p>
<p>Day 6, Randy and I began painting the entertainment center while Cyndi spent some alone time with Kenzie going on walks and playing. Monday night we had dinner at Outback Steakhouse and Randy paid! Nate and Randy had a weight challenge to see who could lose the most weight by the time they arrive here. Needless to say, neither one of them were interested in the health benefits of losing weight, but it was more of a "do what ever you can to shed some pounds so you can win the bet" mentality. And surprisingly, Nate's mental diet (lose pounds by the power of thought) beat out Randy's cashew diet (eating ONLY cashews when you are hungry to satisfy the void of food). And to congratulate the winner, the prize was a big steak dinner to gain all the weight back for the next challenge.</p>
<p>Day 7, we hung around the house as Randy and I did some touch up and a second coat on the entertainment center. That meant Cyndi spent more alone time with Kenzie. Nate finally moved into their new office and it was his first day working out of the home in 3 months. Throughout their visit, we also showed Randy and Cyndi several episodes of Everybody Loves Raymond since we have all the seasons on DVD. And we watched some old home movies of Nate and his siblings when they were babies and little kids. Lots of laughs.</p>
<p>Day 8, Randy and Cyndi's flight left at 2 p.m., so they had to leave for the airport at 12:30 p.m. in time to return their rental car. We were so sad to see them leave, especially Kenzie who wanted to go with Grandma and Grandpa. It is a bit weird to be back to just the two of us during the day... we miss Randy and Cyndi already!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R88AtwcNdhI/AAAAAAAABiM/4Na_MZeAR3w/s1600-h/IMG_7599.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7599.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5174355282969327122" /></a><br />Both grandmas helping Kenzie eat dinner.</p>

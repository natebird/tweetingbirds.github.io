				Tiffany: What do you learn in Sunbeams, Kenzie?<br />
Kenzie: We learn about the Holy Ghost.<br />
Tiffany: What did you learn about the Holy Ghost?<br />
Kenzie: [leaning toward my ear whispering] It is very quiet.<br />
Tiffany: Does the Holy Ghost help you choose the right?<br />
Kenzie: No, <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/02/charlie-t-right/" target="_blank">Charlie</a> does that.		</p>

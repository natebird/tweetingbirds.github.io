<p>Laney makes quite the mess while she eats. Often times we have her eat in the nude so her clothes aren't stained. She won't wear bibs or aprons. She stopped wearing them before she even turned 1. She thought they were too childish and ripped them off every time. Anyway, when she is finished with her meal, we hose her off at the sink. And I don't know where she got this idea to drink from the tap but she does this every time.</p>

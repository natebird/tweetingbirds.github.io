<p>It happened the same way as Kenzie. Laney woke up one morning (Jan. 6 to be exact) and didn't want to let go of the blanket she had been sleeping with. And that begins Laney's pink comfort blankie. It's a pink fleece one that is super static-y (especially when it rubs against her fleece pajamas) and attracts all hair we three girls shed in the house. So it's more like a fur rug than a blanket. Gross.</p>
<p>Laney walks around holding the blanket in one hand and sucks her thumb. What a cutie.		</p>

<p>
<ul>
<li>She acts like such a big girl. Wants to do everything her sister is doing.</li>
<li>I can't get a picture of her anymore without it being burry because she moves to fast.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She loves to try on shoes and wear everyone's shoes.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She loves to sing.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Loves to wear necklaces.</li>
<li>She doesn't say many words - mama, dada, ball, hi and bye.&nbsp;But she will blabber on and on.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She does things her own way and on demand.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When you tell her no, she will do it anyway. No turns it into a game for her. And she can shake her head no.</li>
<li>She loves to climb and get on top of everything. Very good at making me nervous.</li>
<li>She grunts and points at what she wants.</li>
<li>She only gives babies kisses. Until yesterday. She gave me a kiss.</li>
<li>She loves to give her big sister hugs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>When we put her to bed, Kenzie and I sing her a song and talk about what Laney is going to dream about.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She is fast at moving and running places.</li>
<li>Her toes are exactly like Nate's.&nbsp;</li>
<li>She gained 2 pounds in 3 months- that was at her last check up. Weighs 21 pounds and 30" tall.</li>
<li>She knows how to open pens and markers. She loves to draw and write like Kenzie and me.</li>
<li>Very attached to me. Wants me to hold her all the time.</li>
<li>Very curious about everything. Wants to touch everything.</li>
<li>Will eat just about everything except baby food, meat sticks, hotdogs, sliced bread.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Can go up and down the stairs by herself.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

His company has a new employee who Nate is training. He comes over to work at our house a few times a week. The guest bedroom has turned into a mini office, but at least it is heated (his previous office didn't have heat or AC, one of the main reason for moving offices).</p>
<p>It is nice to have him work from home, so I can have access to our car (we only have one). And it saves on gas since he can get to work on foot. The only down side to all this is the fact that Nate actually works more hours when he works from home. He takes advantage of the fact that he doesn't have a commute. So after his morning routine, he starts working and gets off when I tell him dinner is ready, or later. Most of the time he eats his lunch in front of the computer. Every once in a while he does take a lunch break and eat with Kenzie and me.</p>
<p>Kenzie and I appreciate his hard work in providing for our family. Thanks, Nate!		</p>

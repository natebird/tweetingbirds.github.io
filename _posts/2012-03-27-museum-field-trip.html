<p>
				I got to go on Kenzie's field trip last Friday. It was so much fun. I wasn't officially a chaperone because I didn't ride on the bus there and the class had other parents volunteer to be chaperones. So her teacher just let me show up to be with the class for fun. That worked out even better since I didn't have to endure the bus ride full of kindergartners. I dropped off the other two girls at my mom's and met the class at the museum.</p>
<p>It was so much fun. The museum has three parts but for the field trip only focused on the dinosaur part. They went around to different stations and did different activities. We had been there before but the things they did was new and different. Kenzie loves it when I come to her school to volunteer and do stuff with her class. So it was nice to be there and spend the day with her. After lunch I had to quickly pick up the other kids and then head back to her school to pick up Kenzie.</p>

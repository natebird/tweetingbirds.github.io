				Remember that <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/06/flashback-friday-the-surprise/">surprise Nate had for me after only a month of dating</a>? A flight for him to visit Georgia? Yeah. That one. Well, it worked out. I was just glad that Nate and I were still dating so when he came out to Georgia so it wouldn't be an awkward experience. But now we happened to know that we were getting married. So this was Nate's opportunity to meet my family and ask my dad for permission.Â I was excited for Nate to come visit my family. I knew everyone would love him.</p>
<p>So for Christmas break we both flew home after finals. Spent Christmas with our families. Nate told his family that we were engaged and they were excited. The day after Christmas Nate flew back to Utah for his best friend's wedding on the 27th. That same day that Nate flew into Salt Lake City, he had to move his stuff from one apartment to the next with huge amount of snow. I remember talking to him on the phone and his truck was stuck in the ditch covered in snow. Nate attended Taylor and Julia's wedding on the 27th then flew out the following day to be in Georgia with me.</p>
<p>While Nate was here, my dad and I took him around to see downtown Atlanta and go to the old Coca Cola museum. We also did baptism for the dead at the temple with my entire extended family. And for New Year's Eve we went down to see the peach drop in Atlanta with some of my friends and my brother.</p>
<p>Of course my dad knew that Nate was going to talk to him about marriage. And Nate finally did talk to my dad working out in the yard together. And that was that.</p>

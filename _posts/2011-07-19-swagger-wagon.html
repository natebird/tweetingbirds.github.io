<p>On June 25 Nate and I became official owners of a <a href="http://youtu.be/ql-N3F1FhW4" target="_blank">Swagger Wagon</a>, a Toyota Sienna. After over a month of doing intensive research, we decided to go with a Sienna rather than a Honda Odyssey. The Odyssey costs more with less features and been having transmission problems. Nate did the major financial research looking into interest rates and calculating how much our monthly payments would be. He made charts and everything that an economist would do. We even called our insurance to see what a minivan would do to it. And I called around to 10 Toyota dealers asking about what they have in stock new and used. We considered every situation and every vehicle.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4121" title="IMG_8952 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8952.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>Originally we were only looking at used vehicles because we knew we wouldn't be able to afford a brand new one. What we discovered was that minivans hold their value. So when we were looking at 2011 used vehicles, they were just slightly cheaper than the new ones but it kept within our budget. When we arrived at the dealer, we had a great experience with them. They didn't pressure us to purchase anything and they were very useful.Â This dealer had a used car that was exactly what we wanted except for the high milage. It was even in the color that we wanted.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4122" title="IMG_8953 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8953.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Then they informed us that they are having a deal on their new vehicles. They were having a hard time getting in Siennas because of the tsunami in Japan a few months ago caused a slow down in production of certain Sienna parts. Dealers have some vehicles in stock but not many. But the dealer gave us a $3,200 discount on a brand new vehicle that made the difference between the new and used only $3,000 including getting leather put into the vehicle. So Nate and I decided to go with the new vehicle. It was such a great deal on a new one and not having to worry about the used one that had 50K miles on it in one year.</p>

<p>So here we are with a new Toyota Sienna LE. The LE model doesn't come with leather from the factory so the Toyota dealer have professionals cover the seats. Of course they had to do it the week before we left for Washington. So it just added to more things we had to get done before we left for Washington. Nate drove the van to work then dropped it off at the dealer the evening before our leather appointment. Then he picked it up after work the next day, Wednesday.</p>
<p>I am still getting used to driving a large vehicle. I am not used to driving big cars. I prefer economy sized cars. I'm not good at backing up and parking large vehicles. Good thing it comes with a backup camera so that helps with me backing up. And Nate had this great idea to put Apple stickers on the back of the van like those stick family decals people put on their vehicles. I'm not a fan of the family decal at all. But Nate put two big Apples and two little Apple stickers to the back because he's such an Apple fan. We just used the Apple stickers that came with the Apple products we own. Anyway, that's our minivan.		</p>

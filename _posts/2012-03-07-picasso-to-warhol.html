				We went to the High Museum last Saturday to see the Picasso to Warhol exhibit. We were able to get in for free with a museum program through our bank. So that was nice because the masterpieces were spectacular. There were over 100 artwork pieces from 14 twentieth century legendary artists- Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, Constantin Brancusi, Piet Mondrian, Fernand Léger, Marcel Duchamp, Giorgio de Chirico, Joan Miró, Louise Bourgeois, Jackson Pollock, Alexander Calder, Romare Bearden, Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol.</p>
<p>I love going to the art museum. We all had a great time although the younger two didn't last long. So Nate and I didn't have time to read about each art piece. But I love exposing my children to art and cultural experiences. Kenzie also loved it because she learned a little about some of these artists (mainly Picasso) in her art class at school. So she was excited to see some of his art in person.</p>
<p>And of course it wouldn't be a fun trip without a fun story to tell right? Well, the first piece of art you see when you enter the exhibit is Picasso's "Girl Before a Mirror" (1932). The museum has an iPhone app that you can download, take picture of the art piece, it'll recognize the piece and give you info about it on your phone. So Nate and I were downloading the app while Laney decided to walk up to the huge Picasso piece and touch it. Waaaahhhh! I look up and she had hand all over this…</p>

<p>There were people all around us and no one said a thing! I immediately yelled at her and grabbed her from touching anything else. Luckily, a closer look at the painting I realized it was protected by glass. Phew! I didn't want to owe the museum $5 million for my 3-year-old touching a Picasso. But that goes down in the record books that Laney had her hands on a Picasso at age 3. She tried to touch a few other ones but I was keeping a close eye on her after the Picasso incident.</p>
<p>Here are a few of my other favorites…</p>

<p>Kenzie said she liked this one by Henri Matisse because it looks like the people are playing ring around the rosy naked.</p>

<p>It was absolutely amazing. I want to go back again to see it. We left with a Picasso magnet and each girl got a bracelet from the gift shop. Kenzie's said "I know Pablo" and Laney's said, "I know Andy". I love it!</p>

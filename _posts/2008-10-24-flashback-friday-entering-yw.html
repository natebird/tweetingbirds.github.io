That was the beginning of my Young Women years. And now look at me, back in YW, as the president- who would have thought?!</p>
<p>I loved my YW years starting out in Hawaii and ending up in Georgia. I had great and wonderful YW leaders who taught me and helped me through some of the most difficult years of my life - adolescence. I am so grateful for the wonderful girls that were in YW with me, although there weren't many, but I learned something from each one of them. I just hope I can provide wonderful memories for my YW now.		</p>

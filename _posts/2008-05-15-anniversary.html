				Today, Nate and I are celebrating our 4th anniversary! I can't believe it has been 4 years already! We are having so much fun together. In celebration of our marriage, I managed to get sick last night with either a cold or allergies. I have a scratchy throat, runny nose, and a little cough. Kenzie has been suffering through the same thing since Tuesday. But in honor of our anniversary, I am listing all the reasons why I have the best husband in the world (in no particular order)!
<ol>
<li>Nate is so patient with me, especially through all my OCD tendencies (conserving energy and water, organizing everything in the house, and very particular about how things are done). </li>
<li>He doesn't mind that I don't like chocolates and never purchases anything chocolate. </li>
<li>He eats all my cooking even though sometimes new recipes doesn't quite turn out right.</li>
<li>Nate is such a spiritual person and I am glad he exercises the priesthood in our home.</li>
<li>We communicate well together, therefore, we have never been in a yelling match before. And even arguments are to a minimal.</li>
<li>Nate is such a great helper. So willing to help me with anything I ask him to do. </li>

<li>He never complains.</li>
<li>Nate is such a hard worker. He does so well to provide for our family.</li>
<li>I love him for letting me stay at home with Kenzie. It's the best job I've ever had. </li>
<li>Nate takes care of me when I am sick, mostly by watching Kenzie and keeping her away from me so she doesn't get sick. But that's a lot!</li>
<li>I love all the moment when we laugh together.</li>
<li>He is the sexiest person I know!</li>

<li>My family loves him more than me. And he fits so well with my crazy family.</li>
<li>Nate comes from the most wonderful family with great parents. I thank them so much for raising such an amazing guy. </li>
<li>Nate has alway served to his best abilities in his church callings, even if the callings can be time consuming.</li>
<li>He is very charitable, always willing to help others in need by sharing his time, talents, and skills.</li>
<li>Nate is not very creative, but he is so cute when he tries to be. </li>

<li>He lets me take time off for myself to rejuvenate. In fact, he encourages it! He lets me go to mutual night without Kenzie, and allow me to have girl's nights. </li>
<li>I love watching college football and March Madness with him every year. And he cheers for UGA during the football season just because I like them. </li>
<li>He compliments me all the time.</li>
<li>Nate makes me want to be a better person. I know, that's so cliche, but it's true.</li>

<li>He is like his fatherâ€¦ "It'll be fine."</li>

				<strong>Monday</strong></p>
<p>Clean the house and recuperate from a busy weekend. Even though we weren't home most of the weekend, the house was still a disaster. Start on the drapes for the girls' bedroom. I'm putting in blackout lining on the backside of the drapes. Much needed in the summers here where the girls room gets extremely hot since it's facing the sun. And the sun stays out until 9 p.m. and the girls don't want to sleep when the sun is out. Oh, and I realized that I have Activity Days this Wednesday. Must find something to do for Activity Days. Family home evening reading Book of Mormon stories with the girls.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday</strong></p>
<p>Nate's birthday. Doctor appointment in the morning. A second sonogram on the baby because they couldn't check her face last month. This time they saw what they needed. She's still a girl (they double checked, still nothing there). And she's good and healthy. Nate worked from home so I ran a few quick errands after my appointment. Big Lots to get plastic bins to put away girls winter coats and dresses. Bath and Body Works to exchange a couple things in a scent that I didn't like for something I did like. Then to Payless Shoes to get dance shoes for Laney and Kenzie. They were having their BOGO sale.</p>
<p>Since Nate was working from home, when he got off at 3 p.m., he was all ready home. We made an attempt to pick strawberries. The place was an hour away and it was raining. We made it to my parents' house (half way) and decided it wasn't going to work. The rain ruined it. So instead, we stopped at a used tire place and bought a new used tire for my car that we should have had it replaced months ago but never got around to it. Then we went out to dinner with my parents for Nate's birthday at a Mexican restaurant. Then came home at a decent hour to put the girls to bed.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday</strong></p>
<p>The girls woke up at 6:30 a.m. No idea why, except maybe they didn't have drapes on their windows. I'm still working on them. Haven't had much time. So we got an early head start. After breakfast, I cleaned the kitchen (stove and microwave included), the bathroom downstair and swept the floor. I try teaching the girls a new game but it didn't stick. Ended up playing duck, duck, goose. I spent some time in the kitchen cutting a cantaloupe and baking cupcakes. The girls didn't eat their lunch and the rule is you have to eat your lunch to get afternoon snacks. So since they opted not to eat their lunch, I made their favorite strawberry cupcakes for snacks. They didn't get one bite. Kenzie promised to eat her food from now on. We'll see how well that sticks.</p>
<p>I finished one drape for the girls' room, need to start on the second one. Had to stop because girls were arriving at my house for Activity Days. Nate got home a little late because his office threw him a surprise birthday party. Long day but got a lot done since I had an early start.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday</strong></p>
<p>That's today. Dance class for Kenzie at 10 a.m. I now dress both girls for dance even though only Kenzie is in the class. Laney insists on wearing her dance outfit too. After dance I need to run some errands - Payless to exchange the shoes sizes, Target because the girls like to hang out at the princess aisle and the pharmacy to pick up my prenatal vitamins. Nate will be at mutual this evening. So it's mommy's night for the girls and I.</p>
<p><strong>Friday</strong></p>
<p>Cleaning and getting ready for the weekend. It's mother's day weekend and I need to get things ready for my mom. And I think we'll have a chilled night at home since our weekend will be so crazy.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday</strong></p>
<p>I have a guide class for my new sewing machine. I'm going to learn all the features and functions of my machine. I will also learn how to clean it and do regular maintenance on it. Then to a temple sealing of some friends. And game night with some other friends. Also making a quick Costco run somewhere in there.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday</strong></p>
<p>Mother's Day. Church then we'll be over at my mom's house and then over to my grandma's house too. The whole family will be there.</p>

				Happy birthday to me! Nate bought me my first sewing machine for my birthday this year! Isn't he wonderful? I've been borrowing my mom's sewing machine forever now. So Nate thought it would be good to buy me my very own machine. And after much researching, this was the one I ended up with. I love it. It works so well. It's a very basic sewing machine that has so many features and functions compared to my mom's machine that I've been using. I'm enjoying the new luxury. Thanks, Nate!</p>

				It has been quiet on the our family blog, but it has not been quiet around our house. <span style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"></span></span>
<div><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">Warning: this is extremely long!</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Swimming:</span> Kenzie and I have swam in a few different pools with different friends several times this summer but absolutely no pictures to show for it. I forget my camera EVERY SINGLE TIME! I am so upset and I am determined to get some pictures before the end of summer. Kenzie loves the pool and "swimming" in the water with her floaties. I even shoved her down the pool's slide all by herself and she survived - sitting up at first, then laying down, turning, and eventually coming out at the end face down and head first, she didn't drink any water though.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Family: </span>My parents finally came home after their six week long vacation to Taiwan and Thailand. It has been nice having them back, but family events has popped up frequently since they have been back. Kenzie missed her Dudepa and Puo Puo. To catch up on missed time, Kenzie and I spent Monday (yesterday) over at my parents' house just hanging out.</p>
<p>Nate's brother, Nick, flew out from Utah for a quick visit with us a couple weekends ago. Nick was out here for a work conferences and decided to come a few days earlier to spend some time with us. We had a great visit with Nick, even though he beat us in Acquire.</p>

We had a big family get together last Wednesday night for her. It was nice to visit with Claire since the last time I saw her was six years ago.</p>

Since then, we have been trying to order the one part we need to fix it. We should be able to pick it up from the dealer this week and have it fixed before more rain heads our way.</p>
<p>We are also in need of a second car. Dread. With Nate going back to school and working full-time, a second child coming, my OB appointments, and our church callings (Nate in Elder's quorum presidency and I'm in YW presidency), our child(ren)'s wellness checkups, and grocery shopping, it's time for a #2 car. We are looking for something cheap but reliable. We haven't been diligently searching because we need to find a way to pay for it first.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Holidays & Birthdays:</span> Forth of July was great as we went swimming at the Miller's house (my aunt and uncle's) and had a family cookout. Once again, no pictures because we thought we forgot our camera when it was actually sitting in the diaper bag. But we did get a video of Nate throwing Kenzie into the sky in the pool. I'll have to post that later. Kenzie didn't stay up for fireworks. We did, however, do a little session of sparklers and pop-its (where I got ID for at Target because I was purchasing "fireworks"), with Kenzie on our front porch because it was down pouring that evening. Kenzie loved the pop-its, but the sparklers, not so much. She freaked when a spark flew on her hand. Then Nate and I had to burn through 60+ sparklers ourselves.</p>

Nina had her birthday party at the Jump Zone (inflatable bounce place) and Kenzie had been talking about it for weeks! The day finally came and Nina had a great princess and pirates party. All the girls were given princess accessories (bracelets, necklace, tiara, earrings) and the boys with pirate wear (eye patch, swords, pirate earring). Kenzie normally likes to be thrown and bounce around at home, but at the Jump Zone, she was scared. Didn't want to go down the slides or bounce around with her friends, not even if I went in with her. She did have a great time eating pizza and the $60+ princess cake. She still said she had fun at the party and is still talking about Nina's birthday party to this day.</p>

He has a few summer reads for school, a thorough medical and immunization form to complete, pay numerous amount of school fees, and figure out financial aid. He has orientation on Aug. 1, and registration for classes on Aug. 13. Then school starts Aug. 18.</p>
<p>Last Friday evening, we went to an open house for the evening MBA program at his school. It was at a nice hotel with a fancy catered dinner, "free" after the $400 student fee. We had a great time meeting some of his classmates and getting to know some of the administrative members in the MBA office. He even went home with a MBA t-shirt and a gift bag full of stuff advertising for the MBA program. There will be about 60 students in the evening program. Nate is starting to get excited!</p></div>

<p>As many of you are aware and probably thought about, there is always the issue of privacy of your blog in this whole system called the World Wide Web. I have thought about it. I am the kind of person who likes to be unsearchable. I Google myself every once in a while just to make sure.</p>
<p>Some of you have chosen to go private with your blogsâ€¦ good for you. It does make it hard for me to keep up with your blog on my RSS feeds. But not a big deal. Others, like myself, make sure I select "No" in my settings for "Add your blog to our listing?" and "Let search engines find your blog?" Then there are also those who could care less about the whole privacy issue and would love to have people find them on the internet.</p>
<p>I have thought about going private, but haven't done it yet. Mainly because I want to protect images and personal information about my children and family. But a recent email from my cousin who had a friend who freaked about someone checking her blog from a place where she didn't know, and so forth, brought my attention to the fact that perhaps some of my friends may not want me to link to their blogs from my site. Sure, it's a way of "status symbol" of look at how many friends and family I have. Or a way of reminder to check a friend's blog. But it could also be used for other purposes by weirdos who happens to find one of my friend's blog, saw a link to my blog from their site, and hops on the unknown stalker train. And yes, I know blog stalking is a hobby for some of you, but you're not weirdos and don't do it with a negative intent.</p>
<p>Anyway, not to freak you out and tell you to all set your blog settings to private. Rather, I am just explaining, the long way, of why you won't find your blog link to the right of my site anymore. It's not because I'm not your friend. It's for your protection. And if you decide to take my blog link off your blog, I won't take offense, rather, I thank you for helping me keep my family protected by weirdos - not that weirdos check your sites. But you get the idea.		</p>

				Last Sunday after going to church for 3 hours at our ward, we attended the sacrament meeting of another ward for a friend's baby blessing. There were actually two baby blessings that day. The other baby went first. And while everyone was quiet, Laney decided to stand on the pew and yell extremely loud, "And beyond!" It's from Toy Story's Buzz Lightyear's phrase, "To infinity and beyond!" She did it twice. Nice and loud to disrupt the blessing. We were just glad she didn't jump off the pew. She usually jumps when she yells "And beyond!"</p>
<p>Other than that, it was great to see Nate participate in a wonderful baby blessing of our friends, Greg and Jenny. They have 3 boys now and we have our girls. And they play so well together.		</p>

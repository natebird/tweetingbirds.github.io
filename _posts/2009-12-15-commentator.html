				Kenzie came home from nursery with a little booklet she made about thinking of Jesus during the sacrament.</p>
<p>Tiffany:&nbsp;[reading aloud to Kenzie]&nbsp;I can listen while the sacrament prayers are said.<br />Kenzie: Then the man child comes to bring us the sacrament.<br />Tiffany: [reading aloud] I can think of Jesus when I eat the bread.<br />Kenzie: I like eating the bread.<br />Tiffany: [reading aloud] I can think of Jesus when I drink the water.<br />Kenzie: And sometimes it drips on my dress.<br />Tiffany: [reading aloud] The sacrament helps me think about Jesus.<br />Kenzie: Yes it does.		</p>

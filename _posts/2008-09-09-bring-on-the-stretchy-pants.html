I was checking to see how all three of us are doing with our fall/winter clothes - especially me with maternity stuff. I packed away my summer shorts that weren't maternity and started into the stretchy maternity pants. The non-maternity stuff was getting annoying because I was having to unbutton when I sat but it would sag when I stood up. I figured, since I'm at 20 weeks, I didn't feel as bad slipping into pull-up stretchy pants.</p>
<p>P.S. We will be finding out the gender of the baby next Tuesday (if the baby would let us see). Last time with Kenzie, she had her legs crossed at the sonogram and we had to wait another month before we found out. You can take your 50/50 guesses now!		</p>

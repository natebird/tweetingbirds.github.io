				It seemed like all we did in Taiwan was eat. Since the main focus of this trip was visiting friends and family on my mom's side, we had numerous dinner appointments several times a day. Most of the restaurant foods were delicious, but the home cooked meals or night/"fresh" market foods were questionable. You will see why in the pictures below.</p>
<p>We ate enough food in Taiwan to feed a starving country. It was ridiculous how much food people kept bringing or buying us. And they didn't stop until you tell them you were full at least three or four times. The first time we told them we were full, they stop ordering food. The second time we said we're full, they told us to eat what's left on the table. The third time we told them, they insisted on eating some fruit always brought at the end of a meal. And the fourth time we told them, they would ask if we wanted dessert. There was absolutely no way we could say we were not hungry after they offer to take us out for a meal or purchase food for us from street vendors.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SFGGHnyGCuI/AAAAAAAACMg/e_LSMIxXBEc/s1600-h/IMG_8396.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8396.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5211093709340674786" /></a><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Food for Fact:</span>
<ul>
<li>The eggs in Taiwan stores were not refrigerated. Also eggs were served with <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">every</span> meal.</li>
<li>Flies did not bother them around food, they were free to land on food in the street markets or in homes.</li>
<li>Hot tea was served with every meal, didn't matter if it was 90 degrees outside. We were safe by saying we didn't drink tea. But even half way around the world you can still find some yummy orange or grape Fanta! Thanks, Coca Cola. </li>

<li>We didn't eat anything dairy or saw anyone eat anything dairy the whole time we were there. Milk came in the form of power. Toward the end of the trip, my mom finally bought us some "regular" milk and mango ice cream in one restaurant (Kenzie was eating mango ice cream in the picture below).</li>

<li>Most dishes we ate were meat with rice, including breakfast. Not a lot of vegetables. And a lot of sweets in the form of cookies, crackers, or bread all made with bleached enriched white flour. We didn't see anything made from whole wheat. </li>

<li>A favorite way for Chinese to cook meat was braising. </li>

<li>Artificial food coloring had no affect on the Chinese, in fact, they preferred food coloring on their food. Even restaurants would spray hot pink coloring on their rolls. </li>
<li>American fast food restaurants we spotted: McDonald's (they served kimchi in their burgers, see picture of menu below), Dominos' Pizza (had seafood pizza with squid on it), Pizza Hut, Burger King, Wendy's. </li>

<li>The Chinese ate every part of any animal they kill - beaks, feet, ears, eyes, marrow in the bones, heads, claws, legs, and so forth. </li>

<li>We didn't see the practice of preserving raw or cooked food, even meats. Everything was laid out and left out in room temperature (usually around 80-90+ degrees) for as long as they wanted. And let's not even talk about cross contamination! Let's just say the U.S. Health Department wouldn't have enough ticket books to write up all the health code violations we saw in just one street market or local restaurant. </li>

<li>We did eat at some amazing higher class restaurants that had the most delicious Chinese foods, including Din Tai Fung (a famous Chinese food restaurant worldwide), a vegetarian restaurant (where we dined with monks), and other seafood places. </li>
</ul>

<p>Hurray!!! I finally caught up on this blog! I was so far behind, more than 6 months behind. I wrote over 50 posts to get it all caught up. Isn't that ridiculous?! Since this blog is our family journal, I didn't want to miss anything. We just have so much happening all the time. So it's hard to catch up. I was trying to write 5 posts a day to get caught up. Now we can move forward. Yay!!		</p>

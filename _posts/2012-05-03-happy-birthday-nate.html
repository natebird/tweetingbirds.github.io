<p>This guy is amazing. Everyday I count my blessings that he is in my life. He is 32 years young today. I love him to pieces. He is so wonderful to me and our girls. He is the perfect guy to be a father of three girls. He is so patient and loving to them. He is a great provider for the family. He works so hard to make sure we are all happy and healthy. Happy birthday, Nathan!		</p>

				I've been in a crocheting mood lately. For the last couple of months… So pretty much whenever Lai Lai was born… I was itching to get out the crocheting hooks and yarn. And what helped was the fact that I found super adorable crocheting patters on Etsy for hats (<a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/CrochetMyLove" target="_blank">this shop</a>) and shoes (<a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/CrochetBabyBoutique?ref=pr_shop_more" target="_blank">this shop</a> and <a href="http://www.etsy.com/shop/TwoGirlsPatterns" target="_blank">this shop</a>). I did some trade work for them and got a bunch of shoe patterns for free. Awesomeness. I recently finished this pair of boots for Lai Lai I think they turned out pretty cute. Next I'll be crocheting some mary jane shoes for her and then on to hats. After hats I'm thinking I may do some scarves or just keep going with shoes and hats. We'll see. I do have sewing projects I need to do too. I'm glad to get my crafty mojo back.</p>

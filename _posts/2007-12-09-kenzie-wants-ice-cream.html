<div style="text-align: justify;">Kenzie's ability to understand what we say is probably more advanced than the average baby her age. Last Wednesday night, while watching some TV show, I asked Kenzie, "Kenzie, would you like some ice cream?"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Then, Nate and I continued to watch the show, waiting for a commercial break before getting up to get some ice cream. At the commercial break, we both looked in the kitchen and found Kenzie leaning against the refrigerator door with one hand up holding the freezer door handle. We started laughing at the fact that she had been standing there the last few minutes waiting at the refrigerator for us to get her some ice cream. And then, we were laughing at the facial expression she had. It was a straight face looking at us with the glare of "Come on! I'm waiting for my ice cream!" Even when Nate and I were standing there laughing, she kept that straight face which then seemed to say, "What's so funny?! I want some ice cream!"</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The best part was when we actually got close enough to see her holding a little plastic spoon in the other hand. I wish I would have had the camera to capture that moment. </div>

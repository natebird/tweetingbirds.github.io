				Georgia's snowmageddon was in the national news. About 2-3 inches of snow poured on us from about 11 a.m. until late into the evening on Tuesday. The snow quickly collected on the roads and turned into ice. Insane traffic everywhere with icy roads and bridges. It took some people over 18 hours to get home by car then on foot. School buses stranded on the side of the roads with children in them. Some middle school and high school kids couldn’t get home safely from school and ended up spending the night at school. The day prior was 50º and even that morning it didn’t look that bad. But when it came down, it came fast and iced fast. Add on not a lot of DOT snow equipment, people don’t know how to drive in snow and ice, a commuter city with little public transportation, lots of up and down hills, and an unprepared state you get a lot of chaos. We were so blessed and lucky that day. So many of our friends were in the middle of all that mess trying to reunite with their children and spouse. Nate worked from home that day. If he had gone to work he wouldn’t have made it home. I left at 11:20 to pick up Makenzie and we had some icy roads coming home but we made it safely. Blessings! Schools were out the rest of the week and so were lots of businesses and stores. By Friday we were back up to 50º, even close to 60º now. </p>
<p>But the snow made Laney's birthday so special because it was her birthday wish come true. And we all had fun playing in the snow. Although that's when I realize we don't have anything waterproof, not even shoes. </p>

				Last year, we had our annual gingerbread house contest and my brother Jeffrey was in town for it. He's the guru for building stuff. And the girls had a great time. Kenzie had made a gingerbread house at school so she had practice prior to this, well and the fact that she has made one since she was 2. But this year, I used a glue gun to glue a house together for the girls and just had them decorate it. That worked out much better. Didn't take them as long and they didn't get frustrated trying to piece together graham crackers using frosting. Both girls got really creative with their houses.</p>

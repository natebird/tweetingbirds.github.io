				I have been busy being crafty this last holiday season. Part of it was Kenzie's school teacher asked me to make her some camera strap covers. She saw mine a while ago and wanted one. Then she had me make a few more for her friends and family. And then she asked if I could make a tree skirt for her to give the assistant principal as a Christmas gift. And then I wanted to make the girls a few homemade Christmas gifts too so I made Lai LaiÂ some burp cloths and the girls bow headbands (post on headbands tomorrow).</p>

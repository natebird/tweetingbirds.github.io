<p>
				We had stake conference a few weeks ago. I didn't go because I was at home sick with a head cold (day #1 is always the worst). Nate bravely took both girls by himself. When they arrived home, Kenzie was giving me a recap of what happened.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, on the drive home from stake conference Dad asked me what I learned from the speakers.</p>
<p>Tiffany: What did you learn from the speakers?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Nothing. I was too busy playing with my toys.		</p>

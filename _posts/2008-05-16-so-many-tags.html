				<span style="font-weight:bold;">3 Joys</span><br />1. My family… especially Nate!<br />2. <a href="http://www.lds.org/">The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints</a><br />3. A full night's sleep</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">3 Fears</span><br />1. Clowns<br />2. Midgets<br />3. Bugs… particularly ones that can sting or bite</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">3 Goals</span><br />1. To write and get paid for it.<br />2. To travel (Italy, New Zealand, Hawaii, New York City -Nate has never been to the last two places.)<br />3. To lose weight and body mass</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">3 current obsessions/collections</span><br />1. Saving money/budgeting<br />2. Crossing things off my to-do list<br />3. Finding some jean capris or bermuda shorts that's right for my body type.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">3 Random surprising facts</span><br />1. I'm a Mac, not a PC.<br />2. I didn't know what my last name was until I was in the third grade.<br />3. I'm a daddy's girl. I am a lot like him even though we don't have any blood relations.		</p>

<p>I feel so blessed that Nate as a job. There are still so many people looking for jobs these days with the down turn of the economy in our country. Not only does Nate have a job, he enjoys going to work each day because he has a great boss and co-workers. Yay. I don't have to hear him complain about his job anymore when he comes home each evening. One of the biggest factor is he uses an Apple laptop and iPhone at this job where as his last job he had to use Dell and Blackberry. Ha!</p>
<p>I enjoy Nate's work because he has flexible hours and can work from home on some days. We have paid vacation, holidays and sick days for the first time. Wow. And another benefitâ€¦ I get free and discounted beauty products from his work. Nate works for the parent company of three makeup and beauty companies. He gets an awesome discount on products and he may not use them but I do! I love it when he comes home with samples too. Awesome.		</p>

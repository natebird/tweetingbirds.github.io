				We went up to see Nate's cousin, Melanie, who has lived in Hendersonville, N.C., since before we moved out to Georgia. We were there Labor Day weekend. They are not that far away, I think about 4 hours. We haven't been up to see them until now. They have four boys with two a bit older than Kenzie and two around Kenzie and Laney's age. The girls had the best time sleeping over in their cousin's room and playing with their toys and hanging out with their cousins. I love that they get to know their cousins from Nate's side of the family too. Most of Nate's family live out west and we don't get to see them much. It was also fun to hang out with Melanie and Jared. They are such a cool family. </p>

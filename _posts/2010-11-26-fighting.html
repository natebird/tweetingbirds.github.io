<p>
				The girls are at the age where they fight all the time. They both push each other's buttons and get on each other's nerves. There is a lot of screaming and yelling in our house. I've learn to ignore it unless there is blood involved. They have the occasional moments where they are playing nicely together. I like those moments. It's quiet. The other day in a middle of a fight Kenzie yells, "Laney! Don't pull my beautiful hair!"		</p>

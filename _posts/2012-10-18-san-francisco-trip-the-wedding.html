				On Friday we checked out of our hotel and drove to Fremont which was about an hour away. That was where all the wedding stuff was happening. We had a hotel room with the rest of the Bird wedding party, all of Nate's siblings, parents and grandparents. That hotel was super nice and much bigger than the room we had in SF. It was also closer to where all the wedding stuff was happening. Alex's family lives in Fremont and the reception was at his parents' house.</p>
<p>When we arrived in Fremont on Friday, we first ate at In-N-Out burger. We had never been there before. Then we checked into the hotel, unloaded our stuff, got situated. Then we drove over to Alex's parents' house where people were helping to set things up. The kids played while we helped with that we could. That evening we all went out to a really yummy Chinese restaurant for the wedding dinner with both families. It was nice to meet Alex's family. They are very impressive people.</p>
<p>Saturday we all got ready for the wedding. Had really yummy breakfast at the hotel. Packed lunches. Had family prayer with the entire Bird family. Headed off to the Oakland Temple which was about an hour away. It was such an amazing experience in the temple. All 8 Bird kids were there with spouses, for those who were married. And it was also an emotional sealing because we all knew about Randy's cancer but didn't know what was going to happen next. He hadn't started any treatments yet. And it was just a beautiful sealing. Nate and I were filled with tears.</p>
<p>After the sealing we took pictures outside. Then headed back to Fremont for the reception. The reception was amazing. Nicole is very detail oriented and so everything of just perfect and gorgeous. This was everything she wanted. It was a catered buffet dinner. They had a ring ceremony, a traditional Chinese tea ceremony and a program for everyone. They just had their closest friends and family at the reception. We had to leave before the dancing because our girls were just done. More than tired. And we were flying out early the next morning.</p>
<p>It was nice to be home again but we had the best time out there! The girls had a great time seeing California and being a part of the wedding.</p>

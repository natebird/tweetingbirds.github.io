				Painting our house seems to be a tradition on Labor Day weekends now. Last year we painted our kitchen over Labor Day weekend. This year, our master bedroom. I entered <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2009/09/the-despairing-master-bedroom/">a contest</a> hoping to win $200 gift card to HomeGoods and realized our master bedroom needs major help, probably more than the $200 gift card could do for it. Whether I win or not, the least we could do is at least paint it.</p>
<p>I love painting with Nate. He's really good at painting. We learned a lot of tricks along the way. And it helps that he's tall and can reach the high spots. We started at nap time Saturday by moving all the furniture and setting up paint supplies. Then after the kids went down for the night, we started painting. We got most of it done by midnight. But since the fumes were strong in the room, we slept on an air mattress that night. Terrible! It was like sleeping on a balloon. Every time he moved, I bounced. Every time I moved, he bounced. And if I snuggled up with him, we were off balanced and felt like the mattress was going to tip over. We would have slept better on the floor.</p>
<p>Anyway, we finished up on Monday and put up pictures in our hallway. What do you think?

				During quiet time about a month ago, Kenzie came out with her nails and toes painted. She went into quiet time with no paint on her nails. So… I panicked. I could just see nail polish all over the carpet and probably her bed too. As soon as I went into her room, it was clean. No nail polish visible anywhere. Then I started to look for the nail polish. I just knew it was going to be open and laying on it side with polish spilling out of it. Couldn't find it. Later when Nate vacuumed her room, he found the polish closed tightly.</p>
<p>I have no idea how she did it without making a mess, but she did. It was probably a good thing that she did it with her door closed because if I knew what she was up to during her quiet time, I would have put a stopped to it. (OK, I know, totally a helicopter mom.) And the other incredible thing was that she did a great job painting it… She didn't get it on her hand or feet too bad. She actually did a great job doing both hands and feet.</p>
<p>That's a girly girl for ya. Doing your own nails must come naturally to her. And yeah… no pictures. I was too busy panicking.		</p>

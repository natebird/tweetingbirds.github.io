				A few weeks ago our ward had a priesthood campout/ father and son campout. Since Nate didn't have anyone to take with him, he asked my dad to come along. They had a great time together. Nate hasn't been camping in years. We don't have any camping gear so that has been his excuse. Plus I'm not a huge camping person. He said it was nice to be there without the kids. He was able to do whatever he wanted and not worry about taking care of children. Glad he enjoyed himself.</p>

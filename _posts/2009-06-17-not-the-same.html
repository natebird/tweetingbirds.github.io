<p>
				Yesterday, I was going around the house looking for Kenzie's arm floaties from last year to use at the pool. I couldn't find it anywhere. </p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, what are you doing?<br />Tiffany: I'm trying to find your floaties.<br />Kenzie: I don't like floaties. The food in your water is gross.		</p>

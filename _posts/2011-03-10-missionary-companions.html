				One of Nate's missionary companions came to visit us, John. He was in town for a conference and spent the night with us for just one night. Then later they went out to lunch together just before he left. It was fun for Nate to catch up with John. They are pretty good about staying in touch but it has been a while since they have seen each other. John took us all out to dinner at a nice Brazilian Steakhouse. It was delicious. And they even spoke a little Portuguese. They both served in Portugal, not Brazil. Unfortunately, I didn't get a picture of the both of them.		</p>

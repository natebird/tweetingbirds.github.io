<p>Time went by so fast and she is already 2 months old. What lovely child she is. Cannot image life without her. I took her in for her 2 month checkup and she is doing very well. She was 16 pounds (99 percentile for her age), 23 1/4" tall (80 percentile). She is chunky chunky. In fact, her nicknames around our house has been Chunky Chunk, Chunky Monkey and Chumbawamba. She got 3 shots and was not happy about that at all. And at this checkup she managed to poop twice, pee all over everything and puke all over the nurse. Yeah, it was a fun visit for me.</p>
<p>P.S. She is wearing size 3-6 month clothes. I had to put away all the newborn and 0-3 month sizes. Sad.		</p>

				We didn't sleep much the first night. We stayed in a quaint little studio apartment built of concrete walls and tiled floors. The walls are usually painted white or covered in very plain wallpaper. It was in the same apartment building that my cousin, Chen Chei and her husband lives in. My parents had the apartment next to us on the 12th floor. The apartment consisted of a bathroom, a clothes washer, a TV, a little refrigerator, a futon couch, a full size bed, a desk, a couple chairs, and drawers. For some reason, none of the homes we been into in Taiwan had built in closets. They keep their clothes in dressers or amours.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SE_2OTK0tnI/AAAAAAAACKo/BcCSf3MCK18/s1600-h/IMG_8455.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8455.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210654019415225970" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SE_2O4q5cSI/AAAAAAAACKw/nup71P6jRhI/s1600-h/IMG_8456.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8456.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210654029481865506" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SE_2PCnNHuI/AAAAAAAACK4/sPZvP4dQ1GU/s1600-h/IMG_8457.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8457.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210654032150732514" /></a><br />All apartments, most people lived in apartments in the country, looked like prison cells from the outside because all windows had metal bars over the glass. All doors were equipped with a complicated and extreme locking system. Most apartments had two complicated locked doors to get through before entering the apartment. Everyone had fluorescent lighting in their homes. Not a lot of decorations, hard to hang pictures on concrete walls, and absolutely not carpeting, and very little hardwood floors contributed to the feel of a jail cell.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SE_2oqG-JHI/AAAAAAAACLQ/qUFSBjLpBsk/s1600-h/IMG_8462.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8462.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210654472249681010" /></a><br />I personally think it is good to simplify our living standards since in America, we are so concerned about our images that we tend to over do things. But I wouldn't be able to live in Taiwan either because none of the homes I had been in made me felt comfortable or homely.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Rules of Taiwan:</span> Don't drink the faucet water. Don't throw anything, even toilet paper, down the toilet. All bathrooms were equipped with a trash can where you dispose of all wipes.</p>
<p>The hardest part I had with the living arrangements in Taiwan were the bathrooms and the hard beds. First of all, all public bathrooms are the squat and drop toilets. Most public places did not have toilet paper in the stalls. There were tissue papers usually located at the entrance of the restrooms. You grab then go, hopefully you grabbed enough. Public restrooms where the worst smelling things I have ever witnessed. I believe it's from people missing their targets on the squat and drop toilets and the used tissue papers in trash cans next to the squat and drops. There were regular "Western" toilets in homes.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SE_2osluHvI/AAAAAAAACLY/GXX6cJkjNXE/s1600-h/DSCN0670.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSCN0670.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210654472915525362" /></a><br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Interesting note:</span> Tissue papers are used for everything - as napkins, tissues, and toilet paper.</p>
<p>The showers were usually a hose attached to the sink faucet or its own faucet. The bathroom floors were tiled with a drain in the middle of the room. The showers had no curtains or anything to contain the water from spraying all over the room. Therefore, after someone showers, the whole bathroom floor, toilet, walls, and sink were drenched. I hated that. I hate stepping on wet bathroom tile floors with my bare feet. YUCK!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SE_2PFECDMI/AAAAAAAACLA/PizHNJVAynw/s1600-h/IMG_8458.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8458.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210654032808512706" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SE_2PbK9vOI/AAAAAAAACLI/RS2Z9Ko2T68/s1600-h/IMG_8460.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8460.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5210654038743170274" /></a><br />Secondly, the beds were HARD! I felt like I slept on the ground outside without a sleeping bag for 11 days in a row. Absolutely no mattress. It was the height or the bed frame and box spring. In fact, the bed sheets were a sheet/bed skirt combo. As a person who liked to toss and turn in my sleep, I couldn't sleep well at night because it hurt to toss and turn.</p>
<p>I know, I sound like some spoiled American who wouldn't be able to survive in anything but luxury. I guess I am just grateful for my comfortable life here in America. I won't take it for granted any more.		</p>

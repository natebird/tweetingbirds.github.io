<p>
				I was called to a stake calling this time. Luckily it wasn't anything too big. I am the new assistant director of media for the stake. It should be an interesting calling where I get to use my journalism degree again. I am not sure exactly what it entails but I will be the media relations between local media and the stake. And trying to get wards to do newsworthy things and I write articles to submit to newspapers and such. This will be a good boost for my resume. Bro. Shoham is the director and high councilman over this and he had wanted to call me to this calling a few Â years ago but I was the YW president at the time and the bishop wouldn't let me go to the stake. And so when I didn't have a calling he submitted my name and now I'm with the stake. This should be fun.		</p>

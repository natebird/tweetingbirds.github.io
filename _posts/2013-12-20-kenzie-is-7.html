				(back in August) Oh, time. You are playing tricks on me. How is it possible that my little girl is now 7?! She is so full of life and having a great time. Her birthday landed on the Friday after school began. It was a busy week for us. I took cookies (store bought) and goodie bags for the kids in her class. We kept it simple this year.</p>
<ul>
<li>She is still my obedient, rule follower, child. Although she does have her moments, especially at home with her sisters.</li>
<li>Her big lesson she is learning this year that I keep telling her is, "You don't have to be the best, just have to try your best."</li>
<li>She is dancing and loving it. We are trying out competition dance this year to see how it goes. She is loving it so far. They are doing a jazz number. They have extra practices on Saturdays or Fridays twice a month. But she's there with a good group of girls and she is learning harder dance techniques. She is also doing regular dance where she is doing jazz, ballet, and tap.</li>
<li>She loves to read. Yeah, big surprise there. She has been dipping into lots of Roald Dahl, Little House on the Prairie, Clemetine, Wayside School, Magic Treehouse, American Girl Dolls. Nate is also reading Narnia with her. She's definitely a bookworm.</li>
<li>She loves school! She is excited to be back in second grade. I am glad that she makes it easy for me. She does homework without much asking.</li>
<li>She started piano this year. She is loving it. She likes her teacher. I hope she will be good about practicing.</li>
</ul>
<p>For her birthday this year she wanted an American Girl Doll because she had been reading some of the books. We let her decide again this year to get what she wanted or a birthday party. She chose the doll. I took her to the American Girl Doll store to pick out her doll. She picked Kit. We bought the doll and hair brush. She brought her own money to buy a second outfit for Kit. Then we had dinner at the bistro. It was fun to be with just her. Then we had cake with her on a separate day where Puo Puo and Dudepa came and our friend Kat and her daughter Amy were in town from South Africa. I made Kenzie a dirt cake.</p>

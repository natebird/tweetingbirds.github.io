				Since Kenzie didn't get much sleep toward the closing of our Utah trip, Kenzie has been sleeping in in the mornings and taking three hour naps. She slept in Monday morning to around 9:30 a.m. and was ready for a nap by 1:30 p.m. She came up stairs with her blanket and said she was ready for a nap. Poor little girl! </p>
<p>I spent the beginning of last week catching up on mail, emails, blogs, laundry, church stuff, and house projects I put off until after the trip. I hate grocery shopping, so I put off getting groceries until today. We were living off an empty refrigerator. But it was nice to come back to warm weather and see all the beautiful blossoms in full bloom. This is a picture of our back yard when I got home, it's like a jungle out there! We are enjoying nice 80 degrees weather with full sunshine.</p>

I surprised Nate with a dinner at the Melting Pot (fondue) with our friends, Mark and Blair. My parents were able to find a few hours to babysit between all of my dad's bishopric duties last Saturday. We are still waiting for his birthday gift to be delivered. I surprised him with a badminton set for our backyard. He has been hinting how nice it would be to play badminton. The picture below is of us at the Melting Pot. And Sunday, we went over to Bryan and Sarah's for some Rock Band.</p>

<p>And finally, we'll be heading out again at the end of the month for Taiwan. This time I won't be traveling alone with Kenzie because the three of us will fly together there (with my parents on the same flight there) and back. Although, the time difference will be hard to adjust to since Kenzie didn't even adjust to Utah time the whole week we were there. And it'll be interesting with a 20 hour flight there and 18 back.		</p>

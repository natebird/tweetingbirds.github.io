<p>
				Coming downstairs to see beads everywhere from my craft stuff. I had put it up high so Laney couldn't reach it. I knew she would want to get it and play with it. So I asked Kenzieâ€¦</p>
<p>Tiffany: How did the beads get everywhere? Did you get it down to play with it? Or did Laney get it down?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I got it down to show them to Laney. Then she grabbed them out of my hands and got them everywhere. I was going to put them right back.</p>
<p>Uh, huh. She knew and I knew that if Laney saw those beads, she would have them all over the floor in 2 seconds. What a sister.		</p>

				I've been trying to teach Kenzie the alphabet song, which she loves. She starts out with a strong A, a good B, and falters when it comes to C... by falter I mean completely skipping it and has no interest in saying that letter at all. Picking it back up with a decent D and E then skipping much farther down to S. Her F sounds like S and G sounds like D, which is probably what she is actually saying -- S and D. And we can't seem to get anything between G (or in her case, D again) and S. We'll keep working on it and maybe she'll have the song down in a month or so.		</p>

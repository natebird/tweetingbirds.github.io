<p>Kenzie gave a talk in primary on Mother's Day. Her topic was repentance. I sat down with her and we talked about repentance and she told me what she wanted to say in her talk. I added a short scripture and the whole talk ended up being about 4 sentences long. We wrote it out on Thursday and she had it memorized by the time of church on Sunday.</p>
<p>We had her talk written on a pink pieces of paper (of course it had to be pink). And when she went up for the talk, she had her paper out in front of her (holding it) and started to recite the talk. She did such a great job and I only had to help her a bit on the scripture part. Her teachers were so impressed, they asked me if she was reading her talk by herself. I had to tell them that it was by memory. What a cute little girl! I just had to smile during her talk because she was doing it so well. A proud mommy moment for me.</p>
<p>This was her talk…</p>
<p>My talks is about repentance. I can repent when I push my sister by saying sorry. I know that my sister and Heavenly Father will forgive me. The scripture says, "He who repented of all his sins, the same is forgiven, and I the Lord remember them no more." I say these things in the name of Jesus Christ, amen.		</p>

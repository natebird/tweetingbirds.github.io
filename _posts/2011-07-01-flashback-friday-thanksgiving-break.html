<p>The semester went on and our relationship grew. Jeff was keeping a close eye on Nate since Jeff was one of Nate's roommates and was now dating me. Jeff, of course, loved Nate. Who doesn't love Nate? And Jeff was glad to see that I was happy in this relationship too. A total night and day difference from when I was dating Ryan. Nate, since he was rooming with them, became good friends with Jeff, Braden and Grant. They would all speak Portuguese in their apartment because the guys went to Brazil on their missions and Nate went to Portugal.</p>
<p>Thanksgiving break was approaching and Nate asked me to go to Idaho with him. His parents and all the younger siblings at home were going to spend Thanksgiving at their grandma's house in Idaho. He wanted me to come along. I had wanted to stay in Utah for Thanksgiving. Previous years, I would stay in Utah, catch up on a lot of school work, work extra hours for money, and spent the holiday with my family in Utah. I had two sets of family in Orem, my grandma's side and my grandpa's side. So Thanksgiving usually meant I got two Thanksgiving meals and did split time with both families.</p>
<p>Nate kept asking me to go to Idaho with him. We would drive my car up with his brother and sister who were also at BYU. I didn't want to go. We had only been dating a month and going to spend Thanksgiving with him and his family gave the impression that we were in a serious relationship. I didn't think we were at that point in the relationship yet. And we would be meeting his cousins, aunts and uncles from both his mom and dad's side of the family.</p>
<p>After a few days of trying to convince me to go, Nate said he didn't want to go to Idaho for Thanksgiving if I didn't go with him. He wanted to be with me. That was sweet. At this point, I was still the one who was holding back in the relationship. Apparently Nate had prayed about our relationship when we first started dating and he felt good about it. So he was trying to move things along. Nate came along when I wasn't looking for a relationship and was actually not ready to be in a relationship. So I was hesitant when things moved so quickly for us.</p>
<p>After some convincing, I decided to spend Thanksgiving with Nate and his family. It turned out it was his entire family. Grandparents, cousins, aunts and uncles from both his mom and dad's side of the family. Wow. It was a full house. I was sleeping in a bed with Nate's sisters and I met a ton of family members. I missed being with my family dearly and was a little home sick when I spent that Thanksgiving with Nate's family. I didn't know anyone there except Nate so it was a little uncomfortable for me to be there where they talked about family stories and jokes that I had no idea what they were talking about. And I'm sure his family thought we were dating pretty seriously since I showed up on a holiday.</p>
<p>I decided to do my best to have a good attitude and make the best out of it. And it turned out pretty good. Nate has a wonderful family and they were all super nice to me. After a while, it felt like my family in Georgia. I come from a huge extended family in Georgia and was used to a huge crowd at holidays. We spent time with both sides of the family.</p>

Before we would just bath her in water and wash her with baby soaps and shampoos. But lately she has been saying, "Bubbles!" So Nate got the idea to give her a bubble bath. We even had grape scented bubbles blowing into the tub. Nate was doing all the bubble blowing and I took the pictures. Kenzie wasn't quit sure what to do with all the bubbles. It made it harder to see her bath toys.		</p>

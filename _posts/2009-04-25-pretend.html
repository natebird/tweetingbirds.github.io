				Kenzie: Mom, don't tell me not the jump on the couch. I'm just going to pretend to jump on the couch.<br />[Kenzie gets up on the couch and gently bounces on it.]<br />Tiffany: That looks like jumping to me.<br />Kenzie: I'm just pretending to jump. [Then actually jumping up and down on the couch] Now I'm jumping on the couch.</p>
<p>When I told Nate about this, he said Kenzie did the same thing to him.		</p>

<p>Laney loves dogs. So I took her to the pet store when the humane society had dogs out for adoption. She loved it. Had so much fun petting them and letting them lick her hands. We will never get a pet because I can't do pets. It's too much work and Kenzie is allergic to some dogs. I do feel bad for Laney sometimes because she would just love a dog and be so good with it.</p>

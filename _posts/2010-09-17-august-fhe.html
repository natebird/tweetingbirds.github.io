<p>Every month my entire family get together for Family Home Evening. We usually rotate people's homes and take turns being in charge. My family, we get together often and we enjoy being with each other all the time. It's a good thing that I have a great family, or else it wouldn't be as enjoyable. The month of August, it was our turn to be in charge. So everyone came to our house and Nate did an activity with them he learned in one of his classes.</p>

<p>The goal was to have a foot of tape, a foot of string, 10 spaghetti noodles and 1 large marshmallow. They had to use that to try to get the marshmallow as high as they can. Then Nate gave a good object lesson on setting goals and figuring out ways to reach those goals.</p>

<p>Barron and Irene were there too. They're practically family. I do have one of the best families in the world. They mean the world to me and they are all doing good things.</p>

<p>Sam just left on his mission, so we're excited about that. Soon my other cousin Jordan will be joining him. We had two temple sealing this summer with my cousins Beau and Wayne.		</p>

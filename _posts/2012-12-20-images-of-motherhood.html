				Here are some images from my life as a mom. I wouldn't trade this job for anything in the world. And I am so blessed to have the opportunity to stay at home with my girls. I adore them and love them more than anything. So here's a glimpse of my life, sometimes not so pretty, but all moments I want to remember because I know I will miss one day…</p>
<p>The explosive poopy diaper on a kid that won't stay still. Yikes…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6243" title="IMG_4282 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4282.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="388" /></p>
<p>The mess the kids can make right after you cleaned up…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6244" title="IMG_4288 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4288.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" /></p>
<p>The crazy schedules of keeping up with 5 people…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6245" title="IMG_4577 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4577.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="388" /></p>
<p>Finding a jar of pickles rolling around under your driver seat in the minivan and not knowing how long it had been there…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6246" title="IMG_5566 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5566.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" /></p>
<p>Making shirts and skirts and treat bags and games and a bunch of other stuff for school events, special dress up days, parties and so forth…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6247" title="IMG_5573 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5573.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" /></p>
<p>Playing games with the girls and realizing they will never know what a telephone was. Laney thought it was a clock…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6248" title="IMG_5678 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5678.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" /></p>
<p>Orders and purchases aren't so fun with stuff for me any more. It's all baby or kids stuff like diapers and booster seat…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6249" title="IMG_5694 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5694.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" /></p>
<p>Clipping coupons and looking for deals to make the family money last a little farther. Although I don't do much couponing any more on groceries, those coupons stinks…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6250" title="IMG_5712 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5712.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" /></p>
<p>Laundry day consists of me doing 4-6 loads of laundry. It also means I spend most of my time sorting and removing stains from clothes…</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-6251" title="IMG_5781 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5781.jpg" alt="" width="388" height="520" /></p>

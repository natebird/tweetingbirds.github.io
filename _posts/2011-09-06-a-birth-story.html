<p>My <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/08/the-baby-is-coming/" target="_blank">last update about my pregnancy</a> was that nothing was happening even though I was dilated to 3 cm. But the midwife told me the baby should be coming soon. Well, it didn't that weekend. I went into my appointment that Monday to see another midwife, Julie. Julie delivered Laney and helped delivered Kenzie. She's awesome. Well, she checked me and said I was dilated to a good 4 and could stretch me to 6 cm. So she was nervous that if my water broke at home, I might not make it to the hospital in time. It helped that another couple that past weekend delivered a baby at home because they couldn't make it to the hospital.</p>
<p>Julie called the hospital to see if they had a bed open. Luckily they did. And Kim Long was the on-call midwife. I like her. Julie sent us to the hospital right away. I had to go home first to grab my stuff and we had to drop Laney off with someone and arrange for someone to pick up Kenzie from school. My mom wasn't able to make it until a few hours later. So we called a friend, Brittany, to take Laney for a couple of hours until my mom could get here.</p>
<p>We checked into the hospital and got into our room around 1 p.m. I was all hooked up and ready to go. I was dilated to 4 1/2 - 5 cm. But my contractions were 2-3 minutes apart. It was a matter of getting me to dilated. They hooked me up to petocin and got me going a bit. It was a very low drip of petocin. Kim came in at 6 p.m. to break my water and said she would come back in a couple of hours to check on me. By that time, I had gotten the epidural so I wasn't feeling any pain. By 8 p.m. I was ready to go. Kim said it was a good thing my water didn't break at home because I probably wouldn't have made it to the hospital since things went so quickly from there.</p>
<p>I pushed 4-5 contractions and the baby was out. I started pushing around 8:15 and she was born 8:29 p.m. She was a big one weighing 8 pounds 8 ounces and was 20 inches tall. She came a week early from my official due date. My due date was Monday, Aug. 29 and she was born Monday, Aug. 22. I can't imagine how big she would have been if she came on my due date. Or even worst, came a week after. I had an episiotomy because her shoulders were tight. She came out crying. Beautiful little baby. Love at first sight.</p>

<p>I was in the hospital Monday and left Wednesday morning. I could have been discharged on Tuesday night, but the baby had to stay until Wednesday morning for all her tests and stuff. So I stayed with her. We were all doing well and recovering well. My mom stayed at our house for a few days to take care of the other two kids and Nate came home each night to help out - especially getting Kenzie ready for school and such. I was fine staying at the hospital by myself. The nurses were very helpful.</p>

<p>On Tuesday we kept Kenzie out of school so she could come to the hospital to spend some time with us. Laney went to her dance class then they all came to the hospital bringing their lunches to eat with the baby. Then the girls went home so Kenzie can go to her afternoon dance class. Nate went home that evening to help them get ready for school and such the next day.</p>

<p>Tuesday evening was when Nate and I finally decided on a name. We had the hardest time coming up with a name for this one. We didn't like any of the suggestions or any of the names in the baby name book we had. We were back and forth about a couple of the names. The ones I liked Nate didn't like. The ones Nate liked I really disliked. But we wanted to name her before we left the hospital. Going over the names again, we settled on Lorelai. It's a name that was on my list from the very beginning but Nate didn't like it at first. Then it grew on him and when he saw it written, he thought it was cute. And her middle name we got from my grandma's middle name. And it turned out that several of our family members has the same middle name on both sides. That worked out. We like giving our girls middle names with meaning.</p>

<p>I checked out of the hospital before lunch time on Wednesday. The nurse loaded us with tons of goodies - diapers, formula, bags, etc. I was glad to be back home. It was nice to have people bring me food in the hospital but the cafeteria food wasn't all that great. And it couldn't get much sleep with people coming in to check on me and doing vitals. And my room was right by the entrance and next to the vending machines so there were lots of noise. I was glad to be back home.</p>

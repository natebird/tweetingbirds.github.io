<p>Valentine's Day was pretty much non-existent for us this year. Nate and I aren't big Valentine's Day people. We especially don't get each other gifts. Call us lame. We did go out on a date on Friday night with my parents babysitting. We went out to eat at Atlanta Bread Company and walked around Barns and Noble. I had a gift card for the bookstore so we ended up getting a game. Then Saturday we spend the day in Atlanta with some family events (post about it later) and Ikea. That night I started getting sick with a head cold. Yuck. I was feeling pretty bad and didn't go to church on Sunday. Plus I was traveling for a video shoot and needed to over come this cold before Tuesday. By Monday, Valentine's Day all of us were feeling pretty bad with the same symptoms. A lot of coughing and runny nose in the house.</p>
<p>Kenzie had a dance field trip the next day with the dance school she attends. They were able to get tickets to the Atlanta Ballet Company's Sleeping Beauty for $7/person. Regular tickets begin at $78. It was the education showing where they did performances for field trips for schools and such. My mom took Laney for the day. I knew Laney wouldn't sit through the ballet. They had a great time together. Then Kenzie and I headed to Atlanta for the performance. It was awesome. The ABC is pretty awesome. Would love to watch them again. Kenzie was pretty amazed herself. She absolutely loved the costumes. But since the performance had no dialogue she was bored toward the end. After the ballet, we stopped by Nate's office to say hi. I had never been there before and it was close to where we were. We met some of his co-workers. I came back to pick up Laney from my mom and headed home. I had a flight that evening. More on that tomorrow.</p>

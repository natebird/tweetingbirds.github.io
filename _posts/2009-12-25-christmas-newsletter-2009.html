<p>We have been so blessed this year, let us count the waysâ€¦
<ol>
<li>We have the most supportive and loving group of family and friends. Thank you!</li>
<li>Laney is energetic and loves to imitate Makenzie. Now at 10 months, she has 8 teeth and walking/running to keep up with everyone else in the family.</li>
<li>Kenzie is the pink spark in our lives. Never cease to impress us with the words that come out of her mouth. She is all princess and loves the role of big sister.</li>
<li>Nate loves his MBA schooling at Georgia Tech. He has learned so much and all ready putting it to use. He should finish summer of 2010.</li>
<li>Despite unemployment, we survived financially this year through many miracles and answered prayers.</li>
<li>Tiffany began her site www.simplymodernmom.com in July. It has worked its way up to 15,000 readers a month. It is her creative and writing outlet.</li>
<li>We created many family memories attending free events in Atlanta. It is wonderful living so close to a family friendly metropolis.</li>
<li>Both Nate and Tiffany enjoy working with the youth in their ward. Nate is the 14-15 year-old Sunday school teacher. Tiffany is the YW president.</li>
<li>Our house stayed safe and sound during the major flooding in Georgia.</li>
<li>Visits from family and friends. We love having company. Please do stop by and say hello.</li>
</ol>

<p>General Conference weekend October 2003. Saturday morning I called the guys (Jeff, Braden and Grant) to see if they wanted to watch conference at my apartment since they didn't have a TV in <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/09/flashback-friday-the-hole/">The Hole</a>. Jeff was watching it with his girlfriend, Jaimie, and her family. Braden had tickets to conference and asked a girl to go with him. Grant was off with his girlfriend, Kelly, whom he ended up marrying and is now one of my best friends. Taylor was off with his fianc√©, Julia. A ring at my door and Nate was the only one who showed up. I was surprised since I didn't know Nate that well and he had the courage the show up by himself.</p>
<p>He didn't have a TV to watch conference so he showed up. My roommates didn't watch conference and were in and out for most of it. So it was mostly just Nate and I watching conference together. After the first session, I told Nate I was heading up to Salt Lake to meeting up with a couple guys for lunch (Ben and Brandon - guy friends who used to live in my apartment complex but moved up to SLC. They were Ryan's old roommates.). And I was going to watch the second Saturday session in SLC at Brandon's parents' house. It was a little awkward since I didn't really want to invite Nate to go with me since I was meeting other guys he didn't know. But I knew he didn't have anywhere to watch the second session. So I kind of invited him to tag along but hoping he would say no. He said he would be OK.</p>
<p>But then Nate surprised me by asking me to meet up with him after the Priesthood session. He was going to watch the BYU football game with his brother (Nick) and sister (Natalie) who were also students at BYU. They were going to a huge football party at their friend, Alisa's apartment. I wasn't so sure. It sounded like a date. And his siblings and friends from Washington were going to be there. And I wasn't ready to start dating again. It had only been a few days since things ended with Ryan.</p>
<p>"Are you going to watch the BYU football game tonight?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Yes," I responded.</p>
<p>"Then you should come. I'll pick you up after Priesthood."</p>
<p>I gave a hesitant, "OK."</p>
<p>Well, that was the year when Pres. Hinkley ended the Priesthood session a little early because of the BYU football game. It was quite historic. Nate showed up at my door early and I was thinking he skipped Priesthood. We picked up his brother Nick at Heritage on the way. We went to the party and watched the game. It was fun but I was a little uncomfortable the entire time. I didn't know anyone there, which wasn't a big deal. But the entire night Nate was sitting really close to me. I didn't want his siblings or friends thinking we were together or something. And later, I found out there was a girl there, Trisha, who liked Nate and was hoping to hook up with him that night. One of the reasons why he brought me with him. He wasn't interested in Trisha.</p>
<p>After dropping off his brother that evening, Nate dropped me off at my apartment. He walked me to the door and I was feeling really uncomfortable. Totally awkward. It was feeling a lot like a date but I wasn't considering this a date at all. I asked him if he was going to watch conference at my apartment again on Sunday. Then a surprise. Nate asked me if he could come early to make breakfast before conference. Um. OK. This guy was really nice but it also seemed like he was trying to spend a lot of time with me. It was a little too forward for me at that point in my life. I tried not to think too much into it.</p>
<p>The next day we had a great time watching conference. He came early to make breakfast. I made lunch. And my roommates were there watching parts of conference with us. After conference, Nate ended up staying for a bit and we talked for hours. I didn't say anything about my relationship with Ryan to Nate. I didn't want to dump all my drama on this guy. We talked about other stuff.		</p>

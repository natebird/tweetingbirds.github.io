				After a week of getting over jet lag (Nate had the hardest time adjusting of all three of us), cleaning the house (chopping down the forest surrounding our house, a.k.a., our yard), catching up on two weeks of missed stuff (church callings, mail, emails, bills, Nate's side business), and jumping deep into all the projects I had procrastinated until after our return from Taiwan, we have been quite busy around here. So busy that we haven't been taking pictures.</p>
<p>Kenzie turned into a big girl the minute we settled back into our daily routines at home. She has been hinting at potty training the past couple months. But now, she's begging for it. Me, I'm not ready for it. We did purchase a potty for her before we left, but it's still in the box. I finally purchase some princess panties and training pants for her in my last grocery shopping trip. I'm totally dreading the process, even though she seems like she would be easy to potty train since she is begging for it. I know, I know, I better take her offer before I miss the window of opportunity. But she's not even 2 yet!</p>
<p>Signs she is begging for potty training: Kenzie tells me when she is doing a pee pee or poopie. When she is done, she asks for her diaper to be changed, even if her diaper is just a little wet. She won't nap or go to bed with a wet diaper. If I don't change her diaper right away, she'll start the process for me - getting out a clean diaper and wipes, the stripping of her shorts, peeling off of the diaper straps.</p>
<p>I want to move her into a toddler bed before I start potty training. I don't want to do both at the same time because it might be a bit much for her to adjust to. So I have been painting her toddler bed. I got it from a thrift store, it's a twin size bed with the bed frame lower to the ground for little kids. I didn't want to mess with the crib-size toddler beds because I didn't want to purchase a second crib mattress when she will be in a twin size bed for a much longer time. And since it's a twin, I had to get new bedding for the bed as it is the first twin size in our house. I am painting her new bed an ivory white color. It will be done soon!</p>
<p>I have also picked up my sewing motivation and began on more of the animal quiet toys for Kenzie's Sunday bag. I am working on the circus elephants in the peanut now. Some of you may remember the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2007/12/my-craftiness/">family of mice in the cheese</a> I made last December.</p>
<p>On top of all the projects, Kenzie and I had three days of swimming fun. She LOVES the pool and tries to kick her legs in the water to "swim." We got her some cheap arm floaties and she does so well with them. Hopefully I will remember the camera the next time we're at the pool. It's been nice to cool off from the 90+ degrees weather by jumping in water.</p>
<p>Nate has been busy back at work, trying to get Wal-Mart to replace a couple tires on our car (apparently the "extended warranty" we bought on the tires doesn't really do any good), mowing the lawn, and creating his own business on the side. He's doing a web design business for franchises. He has been working on that on top of his regular job and fatherly duties. That's an amazing man!</p>
<p>Other than the potty training thing, Kenzie is talking NON-STOP! She talks in 4-5 word sentences. It has been fun to get a glimpse of what's going on in that little head of hers. The other night, as we all knelt down for family prayer, right before Nate began the prayer, she said, "Daddy big! Kenzie Wenzie little. Mommy little." That caused some laughter during the prayer. Since then, Nate has been trying to teach Kenzie to say Daddy tall rather than Daddy big, he took a slight offense to "Daddy big!"		</p>

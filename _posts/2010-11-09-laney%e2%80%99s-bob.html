				She won't let me put anything in her hair. Well, she will if she sees me doing Kenzie's hair. But she pulls it out as soon as I am done. So I decided to keep her hair as a bob. No point in growing it out if she won't let me do anything to it. Plus it is super low maintenance. She was getting way to shaggy for me and her bangs were into her eyes. Chop, chop.</p>

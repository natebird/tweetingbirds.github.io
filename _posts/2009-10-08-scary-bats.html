				My mom, Kenzie, and I were at Costco. They had their Halloween decor on display. She came home and described what she saw at Costcoâ€¦
<div></div>
<div>"Dad, I saw a huge scary bat at Costco. It had red eyes and a scary smile. But Mommy said it was a fake bat."</div>
<div></div>
<div>Halloween is not very pleasant for her since most of the stuff are scary. She doesn't like anything scary looking. [Insert jokes here.]</div>

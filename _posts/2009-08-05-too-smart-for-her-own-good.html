				Yesterday, Nate gave both girls a bath in our bathroom. They bathe together now that Laney sits up well. As Nate took Laney out to dry off and in clothes, he left Kenzie unattended in the bath. That is usually not a problem since she's old enough not to drown in the 3-4" of water. The problem we usually have with her is dumping water out of the tub. The rule in our house: The water stays in the tub. Nate even reminded Kenzie of the rule before he left her alone.</p>
<p>Well, Kenzie kept the rule. She filled her bath cups full of water, got out of the tub, walked across our master bathroom dripping wet, and dumped the now half empty cup of water into Laney's old baby tub we still have out. Our bathroom floor and rugs was drenching wet. And technically, she didn't break any rules by transporting water from one bathtub to another.</p>
<p>P.S. Laney's third tooth came in, top right in the front.		</p>

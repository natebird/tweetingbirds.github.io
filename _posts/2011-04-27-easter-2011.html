				Three egg hunts in two days is a bit much I've decided. Our house is saturated in sugar! Saturday morning we went to the ward Easter egg hunt. And on the way home while Nate and I weren't looking, they opened their eggs and started eating their candies for their morning snacks. That's after having doughnuts and cinnamon rolls for breakfast at the ward activity. Oh, the sugar overload.</p>

<p>Then we did a little one at home in our backyard Saturday afternoon. No chocolate in our egg hunt because Laney doesn't like chocolate like me. That's a mommy's girl.</p>

<p>And lastly, we left church early on Sunday to make it to grandma's house for a family potluck and another egg hunt. For Easter we gave our girls <em>Tangled</em> and <em>The Princess and the Frog</em> movies, new dresses, shoes and princess necklace making kits. They were so excited about their gifts. They are such girly girls where they were super excited to get dresses and shoes for Easter. Although, I did forget to take pictures of the girls in their dresses. Darn.</p>

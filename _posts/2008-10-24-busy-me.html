				Just a little bit of what I have been up to this week…</p>
<p>P.S. Nate is looking for a new job, so if anyone knows of any IT or programming jobs for Ruby on Rails, let him know!</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">Monday…</span></span> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">Play group with a some moms in the ward.</span> Great playground, a load of fun, and Kenzie had such a wonderful time playing with her friends and in the sand. She was also excited to climb to the top of the purple castle at the playground. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">A s</span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">hort visit to Nate's work</span> so Kenzie could see her daddy, plus we were in the area. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">Ran to the thrift store</span> to find costumes for the youth joint activity. Found a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Rubies-Disney-Piglet-Deluxe-Costume/dp/B00009XO58/ref=sr_1_11?ie=UTF8&amp;s=apparel&amp;qid=1224790874&amp;sr=8-11">Disney's Winnie the Pooh Piglet</a> costume that Kenzie absolutely loved at the thrift store for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">$2.50</span>! The link doesn't show the exact costume, but it was the closest one I could find. Came home. Unloaded the car. Put things away. Made dinner. Then story time with Kenzie before putting her down for bed. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 51, 204);">Worked on half of the clues for the joint activity's costume scavenger hunt.</span></p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">Tuesday…</span></span> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Ran to Michael's again</span> (this was the third or fourth time in two weeks) purchasing more glaze for the <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">R.S. Holiday Workshop</span> (aka Super Saturday) where I am in charge of the calendar tiles craft. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Story time at the library</span> where we met Courtney and Noah. Made a visiting teaching visit out of it. The story time theme for the day was growing up and they made the cutest paper dolls. Kenzie was thrilled! She picked out the pants (purple), shirt (pink, of course), and hair (yellow). And she got to use a glue stick- her favorite part. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Then over to Tannen's house to "visit teach" her,</span> meaning I was there for about 6 hours while our kids played and we chatted, but I did include the monthly VT message. I love visiting teaching friends! Came home. Made a quick dinner. Spent a little time with Kenzie, then put her to bed. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Finished up the clues </span>for the costume scavenger hunt. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 102, 255);">Nate stayed after school </span>to work on a group project.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SQHj8qwvyHI/AAAAAAAACrg/-aN6ydqbDvw/s1600-h/IMG_9272.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9272.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5260736471155853426" /></a><br /><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">Wednesday…</span></span> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">On the phone all morning </span>calling companies straightening out billing problems. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">Updated our budget</span> for the month- so depressing. Talked to a bunch of medical billing people and insurance about my mom's medical bills. For those who were not aware, my mom was diagnosed with cancer last month and is currently undergoing chemo and radiation treatments. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">Baked six loaves of Amish friendship bread</span>- what an arduous task! Those Amish sure makes you work for some good bread. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">Put together the costume scavenger hunt</span> parts and pieces with the clues. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">Sliced </span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">8 pounds of apples</span> for the joint activity refreshments (caramel apples). <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">My mom stopped by</span> to drop off some stuff for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">Saturday's community yard sale</span> in our neighborhood. Nate arrived home just in time for me to leave for the church and set up for the scavenger hunt. I got home around 9 p.m. as Nate was tucking Kenzie into bed- <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 102, 102);">what a wonderful husband!</span> Nate stayed up doing school work, and I passed out on our bed, asleep by 10:30.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">Thursday…</span></span> Began the day with <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">catching up on my emails and a load of laundry</span>, had to wash the thrift store smell out of the Piglet costume. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Mop and swept the kitchen floor</span>- it had been neglected too long as with many other things around the house. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Organized and prepared for the YW service auction</span> in conjunction with the ward trunk-or-treat. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Cleaned the kitchen.</span> Put Kenzie down for a nap/quiet time. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">My brother came over</span> for me to help him study for the ACT and apply for his first credit card. I made dinner. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Did a video chat with Nate's mom and sisters.</span> I had to show them Kenzie's new costume. It took some coaxing to get her in it. Found out it's a bit short, but hopefully pink tights will fix the problem since she insists on being Piglet for Halloween. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 153, 0);">Nate stayed after school </span>to work on a group project.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">Friday…</span></span> Went to bed late last night and <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">got up early this morning</span>- I'm going to be exhausted by mid-day. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">It's raining</span> and I am loving it! It's nice to have a rainy day every once in a while. On my to do list today… <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Catch up</span> on my blog. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Pack the car</span> full of YW stuff for the service auction tonight. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Get Kenzie's costume and treats</span> ready for trunk-or-treating this evening. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Clean the house:</span> vacuum, dust, clean the oven, and organize the playroom. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Call mom</span> to find out when she plans to drop off more items for the neighborhood yard sale tomorrow. Hopefully <span class="Apple-style-span" style="c<br />
olor: rgb(153, 51, 0);">Nate will get home on time tonight</span> so we can arrive at the church early to set up for the service auction. It is forecasted to be rainy, windy, and cold tonight, so we'll see how the trunk-to-treat goes, especially since we have about 150 Primary kids and babies in our ward. Yes, I think we're the only ward throughout the state to have THREE nursery classes.		</p>

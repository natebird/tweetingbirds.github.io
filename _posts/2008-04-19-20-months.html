				Kenzie…
<ul>
<li>Likes to watch Barney now.</li>
<li>Can identify and say all 26 letters (capitals).</li>
<li>Says please, sorry, you're welcome, and thank you.</li>
<li>Doesn't like bugs (like her mom), scared of them.</li>
<li>Is still very careful and cautious in every way.</li>
<li>Doesn't sit in a highchair anymore. Now sits on a step on a big chair at the dinner table.</li>
<li>Likes to yell the same word or name over and over again. First, it was Elmo, Elmo, Elmo… Then, it was Ernie, Ernie, Ernie… And now it's naked, naked, naked… In fact, she often takes off her pants so she can run around in circles yelling naked, naked, naked…</li>
<li>Still loves to cook and feed her stuffed animals. But now, she also likes to put them to sleep by laying them on a blanket or a pillow and tuck them in with a blanket. </li>
<li>Can count up to three by herself and say up to 10 with mom's help. Knows the difference between numbers and letters.</li>
<li>Refers to herself as Wei Wei, her Chinese nickname. Everyone in my family calls her that.</li>
<li>Drew circles on her Doodle Pad by herself and said, "Circles!"</li>
<li>Climbed out of her crib and fell after her afternoon nap on April 15 to celebrate tax day. </li>
<li>Asked to sit on the potty on April 16, but when I put her on there, she freaked. </li>
<li>Says the names of the animals now and not just make the animal sounds.</li>
<li>Favorite songs are "Ring Around the Rosy," "The Library Boogie (by Tom Knight)," "Itsy Bitsy Spider," "Hokie Pokie," and "Head, Shoulder, Knees, and Toes." And she knows the motion/dance to all of these songs.</li>
<li>Everything (Big Hello Kitty and Little Hello Kitty; big puppy and small puppy; packages of crackers; books) has to come in twos… one for Mommy (usually the bigger one) and one for Wei Wei.</li>
</ul>

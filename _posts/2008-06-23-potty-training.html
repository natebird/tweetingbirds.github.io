				I know I just posted a few hours ago about how I wasn't going to start potty training until after I get Kenzie in her toddler bed. Well, here's what happened todayâ€¦</p>
<p>First of all, I finished painting her bed today. Now I am just waiting for it to fully dry before putting it together. The 90+ degree weather outside will help speed up the process. Pictures will be posted once that is done.</p>
<p>Back to the potty story. Kenzie and I checked the mail today and I received the <a href="http://www.pull-ups.com/na/potty_training_DVD.aspx">free Huggies potty training DVD</a> I requested online. It's a DVD giving parents tips on potty training, including some fun children's sing-along songs about potty training. It also came with some coupons for training diapers, Huggies' Cleanteam cleaning products, and Crayola products, and Yoplait yogurt.</p>
<p>Kenzie saw the DVD and quickly said, "Watch movie!" I popped the DVD in while Kenz and I snuggled up on the <a href="http://www.lovesac.com/sacs/supersac.html">LoveSac</a> to watch the propaganda on Huggies products. The cheesy DVD gave some great tips on potty training, and Kenzie loved the sing-along songs about potty training. She wanted to watch that over and over again. Watching the DVD got Kenzie excited about potty training and she was talking all about it.</p>
<p>Then the following conversation took place.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, do you want to potty train?<br />Kenzie: No.<br />Tiffany: Do you want to use the potty?<br />Kenzie: No. Potty too big.<br />Tiffany: Well, mommy has a surprise for you!</p>
<p>I went up stairs, got the potty seat we purchased a month ago, along with the potty training children's book for girls with a button that made a flushing sound. I came back down with the surprise and I got the response, "Oooohhhh! Potty!" She was more than excited.</p>
<p>Totally not ready to potty train this girl, and with absolutely no plan in mind, I thought I could at least pull out the potty for her to get used to seeing around- motivational tool. As soon as we set up the potty seat in the bathroom downstairs, Kenzie was taking off her pants and wanting to jump on the potty.</p>
<p>First attempt, seconds after we set up the potty in the bathroom, Kenzie sat there but nothing came out. She was quite amused by the potty and toilet paper. She would sit there and look into the potty cup and say, "Nothing there." I explained that she would need to put her bodily wastes in there when her body gave her the right cues.</p>
<p>Second attempt, right after her nap, she had wet her diaper. So I knew she wasn't going to go on the potty but she wanted to sit on it anyway. I still had her in diapers today because I was totally not expecting it to be the first day of potty training.</p>
<p>Third attempt, during snack time, Kenzie looked like she was doing a #2. She then turned to me and said, "Poopie." I asked her, "Do you want to go on the potty?" And she said OK. I rushed her to the potty in the bathroom, stripped off her diaper and she sat down. Her first response was, "Nothing there." But I then explained she had to squeeze out her poopie for it to go in the potty cup. She made some squeezing noises, but it seemed like she was just playing around. A few minutes later, she stood up and proudly said, "Done!" Yup, her first little poopie in the potty! I tried to get her to sit back down so I can wipe her and make sure she was done. But she looked down there and said, "Grossie!" and wouldn't sit back down. I wiped her then put her diaper back on with a lot of excited congratulations from me. I was so proud of her for going on the potty! We called daddy at work so she can tell him what she did today. Then we called Grandma (Nate's mom) to share with her the good news. Both phone conversations, Kenzie simply said, "I poopie in the potty."<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SGBEM0EJFxI/AAAAAAAACTo/CvPZoDYpI4o/s1600-h/IMG_8764.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8764.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215243355420170002" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SGBEM29hUgI/AAAAAAAACTw/FwOYoBKnj4g/s1600-h/IMG_8766.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8766.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5215243356197704194" /></a><br />Forth attempt, immediately after dinner, I told Kenzie to show daddy her potty in the bathroom. She took Nate into the bathroom and showed him her little set up next to the big potty. When they went in there, she told Nate she wanted to go on the potty. He took off her diaper and let her sit on there. We both thought she just wanted to show him how she sat on the potty. But to our surprise, she did a #1 on the potty!</p>
<p>Like I mentioned in the previous post, Kenzie was more than ready to potty train. And as it happened today, she did everything so well! I couldn't have been more proud of this little girl. Since I wasn't prepared for potty training today, we didn't have rewards or treats for her. However, she was just happy to go on the potty by herself and loved all the praise she received. We did treat her to some ice cream tonight for dessert. What a big girl!		</p>

				We really had a lovely Christmas this year. We wanted to focus more on doing things together as a family rather than presents for the kids. They didn't even noticed that they had less gifts under the tree this year. Or that they didn't get any expensive gifts this year. I didn't want to give the girls toys for Christmas because I was tired of picking up toys. The girls didn't need anything and they already have too much stuff at home. Nate and I did go out a little more on our gifts for each other though. This was the year where the parents were spoiled. Hehehe.</p>
<p>Santa brought the two older girls a music box and jewelry to go in it. And then he gave us a few family games, which we love. Nate got me the <a href="http://www.silhouetteamerica.com/silhouetteCameo.aspx" target="_blank">Silhouette crafting machine</a> that I had been eyeing for a while. And we also counted my new camera as my Christmas and birthday and mother's day and any other gifting holidays for the new several years. Hehe. I got Nate two <a href="http://www.nest.com" target="_blank">Nest thermostats</a> that he really wanted ever since they came out with it. And a super fun game called Power Grid.</p>
<p>Best moment of Christmas morning this year was as Nate was opening a gift from me that was flat, Laney said, "Open it, dad! I think it's a robot inside." And it was. They were cardboard robots to go with the Power Grid game. She was spot on and had no idea.</p>
<p>Lai Lai loved opening gifts. She ripped the wrapping paper into tiny pieces as she unwrapped it. Her favorite gift was from Santa, a metal shopping cart. We got a few other little things here and there, like movies and clothes, jewelry and such. We have been so blessed this year and I also got amazing deals on a lot of these gifts. I keep an eye out for deals all year long.</p>
<p>This year I didn't do a big breakfast like I did previous years. And later that afternoon we went over to my grandparents' house to have a family get together there. It was such a nice Christmas. I loved it.</p>

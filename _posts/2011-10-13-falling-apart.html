<p>Laney has had it rough lately.</p>
<ul>
<li>She has this obsession with ripping off her nails - fingers and toes. She picks at it until she can pull it and then it gets too short and starts bleeding. I don't know why she does that. I guess it's like kids who bite their nails. But this one seems so painful.</li>
<li>One of her pinky toe nails actually came off entirely. She must have stubbed it or something and it lifted the toe nail up. It eventually came off after a few days.</li>
<li>She got bit by ants. She was out for a walk with her grandparents and she saw what looked like a pile of dirt. It turned out to be an ant hill. Those ants gave her some nasty bite marks/worts on her hand. It's gone now.</li>
<li>She had her stomach virus that caused canker sores all in her mouth. Those were tough because she kept complaining that her teeth and mouth hurt. It took about 5 days for it to go away.</li>
</ul>
<div>Throughout all this she has been a trooper.</div>

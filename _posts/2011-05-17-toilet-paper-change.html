				Over the Easter weekend, we were over at my grandparents and my parents' house. At my parents' house, the girls took a bath there so they could fall asleep clean on the way home. Nate accidentally picked up a roll of my parents' toilet paper when he was picking up the girls' clothes and putting it in our bag. When I cleaned out the bag the next day, I found the roll of toilet paper, found it weird that there was a roll of toilet paper. But I thought maybe one of our girls playing in the bathroom at my parents' house and put it in our bag. It wasn't a big deal and my parents wouldn't care. So I just put the roll in the bathroom downstairs. It had just ran out of toilet paper.</p>
<p>Later that day, Kenzie did her business in the bathroom and with the door closed, I heard her yellâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: What?! That's not our toilet paper! Our toilet paper has flowers on it. Where did this toilet paper come from?</p>
<p>She's so observant! I didn't even know our toilet paper had flowers on it.		</p>

				The other day in a conversation with between Kenzie and Nate. Kenzie said for her 16th birthday she wanted me to teach her how to sew and a ride around our neighborhood in the minivan. So Nate thought this would be the perfect opportunity to get that on recording to show her on her 16th birthday and we would give her no gifts other than those two things. Using his iPhone the video record Kenzie, the conversation went like thisâ€¦</p>
<p>Nate: Kenzie, what is it that you want for your 16th birthday?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I want mom to teach me how to knit [somehow she switched from sewing to knitting, too bad she doesn't know I don't know how to knit.] and a ride around the neighborhood in the minivan.</p>
<p>Nate: That is all you want for your 16th birthday?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yup. Oh. And a shoe.</p>
<p>Nate: Just one shoe?</p>
<p>Kenzie: No. Two shoes. Two wedding shoes.</p>
<p><em>Nate immediately cut the video.</em></p>
<p>Nate: I'm going to have to edit that last part.		</p>

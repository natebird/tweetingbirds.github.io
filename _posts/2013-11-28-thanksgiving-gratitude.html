				We have so much to be grateful for this year. Blessed beyond our means! Recently in a Relief Society activity we were challenged to list 100 things we are grateful for and they had categories. Here's my list…</p>
<p>10 Living People You are Grateful For</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Nate. </strong>He is my best friend. I am always amazed at our relationship and how well we get along all the time. I love being married to him. He is absolutely perfect for me. We know exactly when to be there for each other and support each other when the other one is down. We hardly ever argue. We have had disagreements but we never yelled at each other before. We both completely trust each other with everything and know that we are both doing our best with our marriage and family life. He has his strengths and I have mine and they work well complementing each other. I am so glad we found each other in college. It was destiny, fate, and the perfect love story.</li>
<li><strong>Kenzie.</strong> She is mini me from day one. She is my helper and my little buddy. She makes life easy by being so obedient. She loves school and does her homework on her own. Doesn't complain about having to practice piano. She does her best each day to choose the right and be an example to her sisters.</li>
<li><strong>Laney.</strong> She is the spunk in the family. I love her creative spirit and energy. She is curious about the world around her. She is also observant. She is a fighter and doesn't let things stop her from achieving her dreams. She is such a girly girl but not afraid to play in the dirt.</li>
<li><strong>Lai Lai. </strong>She is not a pushover, she knows how to defend herself. She is sweet and thoughtful of others. She is mommy's girl, and I love that. She can do what anyone else is doing, especially her sisters. She is so talkative. She doesn't like to be left out of things.</li>
<li><strong>One on the way.</strong> We are so excited for this next baby girl. She will fit right in with all the girls. We have been blessed with all our children. Can't wait to meet her.</li>
<li><strong>My mom.</strong> She is the most charitable and friendly person I know. She is always thinking of others and what she can do the help them. She is especially good at making friends with people from other countries, even if she can't communicate well with them due to language barriers.</li>
<li><strong>My dad.</strong> He has been a great dad to all of us. We have a lot of fun together and great conversations. He has always inspired me that it is never too late to learn something new. And to create your own adventures.</li>
<li><strong>Cyndi.</strong> I adore Nate's parents. Cyndi is such a great mom and I learn so much from her. She raised eight wonderful children.</li>
<li><strong>Randy.</strong> He is such a hard worker and a people person. Very humble. I love that Nate is his father's twin. They are great men.</li>
<li><strong>Jeffrey.</strong> My only brother. We have many great memories together. It has always been the two of us, and we take care of each other.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong></strong>10 People Who Have Died You are Grateful For</p>

<li><strong>Agong (my grandpa).</strong> He helped raised me when I was little living in Taiwan. I remember him singing songs to me at bedtime and teaching me Japanese. We would watch Japanese sword fighting shows together. He would walk me to school and pick me up after school.</li>
<li><strong>Joseph Smith.</strong> Restoring the gospel so I can be a part of it.</li>
<li><strong>President Gordon B. Hinckley.</strong> He influenced me so much throughout me teen and college years. I love his relationship with his wife and his humor too.</li>

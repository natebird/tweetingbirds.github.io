				The sewing machine, that is. I am so excited about my latest accomplishment! It's a nursing cover, aka "Hooter Hider."</p>
<p>I didn't really use a nursing cover with Kenzie. I had bought one from the store, but the material was too hot, I couldn't see Kenzie or anything under the cover, and no ventilation for her to breath while nursing. So I eventually just ditched the whole thing. Blankets didn't really work for me either because it kept falling off my shoulder or fall off anytime she moved.</p>
<p>With my second child, I'm attempting this Hooter Hider (yes, that's the brand name) that has received high reviews from many nursing mothers. I checked online for Hooter Hiders and the cheapest I found was $30. I knew I could do it for lessâ€¦ plus I had an itch from <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/01/my-latest-obsession/">my latest obsession</a>.</p>
<p>My nursing cover is a reversible one. And the cheapest one I saw for a reversible one was $45. I made mine for much less. Of course, it took a bit of time, but it was actually fun to make! I wanted a reversible one so that if one side gets dirty, just flip it over. So check it out! I'm so excited to use it!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SWgku-O-JpI/AAAAAAAAD-E/e-m6ToU1dTQ/s1600-h/IMG_9654.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9654.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289518151745021586" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SWgkuvw6FoI/AAAAAAAAD98/xMduGQBmKc4/s1600-h/IMG_9655.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9655.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5289518147860829826" /></a>		</p>

<p>Nate's parents' home is a magical place. It is so perfect for children because they raise 8 of their own kids there. Randy built the house himself. It took years and now there are so many memories in that home that they will never be able to sell it. None of the kids will let them sell it. The picture above is of their nice bricked garden.</p>

<p>The garden is full of beautiful flowers.</p>

<p>And peach trees and tomato plants and onions…</p>

<p>The Birds are fruit people. They have rows and rows of raspberries. A few peach trees and their neighbor has an orchard that they can pick from. I think a few of the orchard trees are actually on the Bird's property. That's the orchard behind Laney.</p>

<p>They have a nice fenced in yard with a treehouse, sandbox, swings and a net up for volleyball or badminton.</p>

<p>And because they are croque playing people, sometimes they mow the lawn in the path of a croquet game.</p>

<p>Not too long ago the upgraded and had some add on to their property. You know, kids are grown and mostly out of the house, so time to upgrade, right? So they built a shop for Randy's work vans and other shop stuff. They also made a nice back deck.</p>

<p>So you see… They can't ever sell this place. We love it too much.		</p>

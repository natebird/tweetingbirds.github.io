				We had the best time at Disney World with Nate's parents this year. A big part of the Disney experience is to meet the characters, especially if you have little children who admire princesses. This year we went to Epcot first and met a lot of characters there. That was the way to go. The lines for characters were much shorter there.</p>

<p>I was surprised that Lai Lai wasn't afraid of the characters. She didn't warm up to them easily, but she didn't cry either.</p>

<p>Laney was afraid of the Beast. But she still went and said hello to Belle. Nate was filming the whole thing and the Beast came up really close to Nate's phone while filming.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5870" title="IMG_1434 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1434.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /></p>

<p>Both girls got really excited to see Princess Aurora. We got lucky and were the first in line to see Princess Aurora. And when the girls saw her walking towards them, they were jumping up and down.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5872" title="IMG_1449 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_1449.jpg" alt="" width="347" height="520" /></p>
<p>Then the photographer told the girls they could run up and greet her. So the girls did. And Laney fell tripping over something on the ground. She got right back up though.</p>

<p>Princess Aurora was so nice to the girls and spent quite a bit of time with them. She even played hide-and-seek with the girls. It was their dream come true. Priceless.</p>

<p>This year they got to see Rapuntzel whom they had not seen before. They loved her. She was a must-see on Laney's list.</p>

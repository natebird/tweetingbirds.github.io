<p>I have read the Book of Mormon cover to cover a few times before in my life. I wanted to do it again before I turned 30. It is interesting the things that stand out to me at different points of my life. I was glad to finish read it a month before my birthday. I found it hard to do a daily reading because of the things that happened every day. But I would plow through a week's worth of reading on Saturday and Sunday mornings. 		</p>

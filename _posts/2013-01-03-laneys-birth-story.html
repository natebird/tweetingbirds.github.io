				I know. The kid is almost 4 and I just realized that I didn't write down her birth story on here. I was looking back on this blog's posts and I just said she arrived with cute pictures of her. I can't believe I forgot to write down the details of her birth! Better late than never, I guess.</p>
<p>Early in the morning, around 4 a.m., I got up to go to the bathroom. I thought my water broke. My water broke with Kenzie. And I thought it did again. It was too early to go into the doctor office to get checked. I waited around to see if I could feel any contractions. Nothing. But that happened last time too. I couldn't feel contractions until much later.</p>
<p>I called the OB-GYN office that connected me with the midwife at the hospital. I explained the situation and the midwife said I could come in to get checked at the hospital. At my last doctor appointment I was at a 3 cm. My due date was that Saturday. It was Wednesday. Nate and I talked a bit about what we should do. I think I was more excited to get the baby out than anything. So we decided to head to the hospital. By this time it was around 5ish. We called Stacey who came over to the house to be with Kenzie until my mom could get to the house. Then we packed the hospital bag. Yeah, didn't have one packed ahead of time. Ooops. And then we were on our way to the hospital.</p>
<p>We got there, registered and the midwife, Kim Long (who delivered Lai Lai) took a while to get to us. But not a big deal since I wasn't feeling any contractions. She checked me and nope. My water didn't break. Huge disappointment. She was on her way out and the next midwife was Julie, who helped delivered Kenzie. I love Julie. She said if I walked around and get dilated to about a 4 cm then I can stay. So Nate and I started pacing around the hospital floors. I was just a few days early and would hate to go home after all this! She checked me after a while and I was close enough. Thank goodness she was so nice! I was about to start begging! I think a few other factors helpedâ€¦ I normally have big babies, I had gestational diabetes, and I just looked pitiful.</p>
<p>We got into a room and the waiting started. She got me on patocin to get the contractions started. Nate's parents were on their way in that day. Perfect timing. Julie and the nurse came in a few times to check on how I was doing. When I got to about 7 cm, I asked for the epidural. It was getting pretty painful by that time. We waited some more and then around the time I was at a 9 almost 10 cm, my epidural wore off. So the nurse asked for the anesthesiologist to come back and give me a second dose. Well, they were rotating staff at the time and when the new assistant finally came to give me the epidural I was pretty much at a 10. I got the epidural but it didn't kick in. I could still feel the contractions and the pain. It was pretty intense. The nurse thought that maybe waiting a few contractions would allow the epidural to kick in, but it didn't. So Julie just told me to start pushing. It actually felt better to push. With just 3-4 pushes she was out.</p>
<p>Born at 1:46 p.m. 7 pounds 12 ounces. 18 inches tall. She was the smallest and shortest baby I've ever had (including Lai Lai). She came out and didn't make a sound. It seemed like a long time but I'm sure it was just a few seconds before the nurse cleared her out enough for her to start breathing and crying. I panicked a bit there until I heard her yell. One of the first things I noticed about her was her toes. She had toes like Nate. It was pretty cute. After she came out, the second dose of epidural kicked in. Even when they unhooked me from it, I couldn't feel a thing waist down. It was like that for several hours. They were trying to transfer me onto a different bed and move me to the recovery room and I couldn't move below the waist.</p>
<p>Recovery wasn't bad. Much better birthing and recovery experience than with Kenzie. It was nice to have Nate's parents there with us. Nate's mom is always a huge help and I love her company. Nate's dad stayed a week. Nate's mom stayed two weeks.</p>

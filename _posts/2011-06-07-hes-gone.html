				Kenzie: Mom, Dad has been gone for so long.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Yup. He's still at work.</p>
<p>Kenzie: I miss him so much.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Me, too.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Maybe we can make him a card and mail it to him.</p>
<p>The girls see Nate more now than when he was in school. But they still miss him when he's not home with emergencies or meetings at work that causes him to stay later. Or when he's away with his church calling as the YM president or priesthood duties. And sometimes when he is home, he's working (work emergencies) or answering emails or working on side projects that causes him to be here, but not really here.		</p>

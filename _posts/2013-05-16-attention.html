				Tiffany: What did you do at school today?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Well, in Quest we built a tower out of straws and connectors. My group built one so high that it touched the ceiling. </p>
<p>Tiffany: Wow! That's very tall!</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah! And everyone in the class came to look at it. It was well noticed. 		</p>

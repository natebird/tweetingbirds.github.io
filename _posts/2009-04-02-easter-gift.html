<p>
				Now that I have the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/03/im-one-of-those-moms/">Pocahontas toy</a> in hand, I have been trying to convince Kenzie that perhaps Pocahontas will arrive for Easter rather than her birthday in August. I have been having a conversation about how Pocahontas is missing several times a day with this girl. Yesterday, one of the conversations went as follows. </p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, my Pocahontas toy is missing. The store took my Pocahontas toy. <br />Tiffany: You don't have a Pocahontas toy. <br />Kenzie: Maybe I'll get her for my birthday.<br />Tiffany: What if she comes for Easter?<br />Kenzie: No, she is coming for my birthday. <br />Tiffany: But Easter is next Sunday. Your birthday is not until August, that's a long time from now.<br />Kenzie: No, Pocahontas has to come to my birthday party. </p>
<p>Dang. But today she may be changing her mind.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, I'm missing my Pocahontas toy.<br />Tiffany: Where is she?<br />Kenzie: She's at the store. [Throwing both hands up and out to the sides as in a-matter-of-fact.]<br />Tiffany: Is she going to come visit you?<br />Kenzie: Yeah, maybe for my Easter birthday.		</p>

				Nate seeing Kenzie sitting by herself in a room at Grandma's house in Washington.</p>
<p>Nate: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I'm just thinking about all the things that I am not good at doing like hula hoop.</p>
<p>Nate: But you are good at a lot of other things like running and dancing.		</p>

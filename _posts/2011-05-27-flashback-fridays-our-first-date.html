<p>The Tuesday after General Conference, Nate called me on my cell phone during the day to see if I wanted to meet him at the library to study. By this time, Nate and I were becoming friends. But like I've said over and over again before, I wasn't looking for a relationship. I was not ready to date yet. I was moving on with my life and enjoyed getting to know Nate better. While we were studying at the library, I was reading textbooks while Nate was browsing on his laptop. He was checking to see what movies were at the Dollar Theater that night since Tuesdays were 50 cents night. He saw that the <em>Italian Job</em> was at the Dollar Theater and asked me if I had seen it before. Nope. So he asked if I wanted to go watch it with him. I said yes even though I knew it sounded like a date. He didn't say specifically it was a date, but he was going to pick me up that night for the movies and it was just going to be the two of us.</p>
<p>I was getting the butterflies just before Nate came to pick me up for the movies. I was nervous because Nate's such a great guy and this was my first date since Ryan. Whoa. I didn't know what to think of it. I dated a lot while I was at BYU and was never as nervous as this date with Nate. I didn't know why I was making such a big deal out of it. He came to pick me up and we hopped in his blue Toyota truck. We watched the movie and had a great time. But during the movie I could tell Nate was fidgeting in his seat. I could tell that he wanted to hold my hand. More butterflies in my stomach. I wasn't ready for that at all. But toward the end of the movie, I finally decided to help him a bit. I casually put my hand on the armrest that was between us. A couple minutes later, Nate said a super cheesy line and put his hand on mine. I couldn't help but smile and try not to laugh at his cheesy line. And that was that. We walked out of the movie theater holding hands and also all the way back to my apartment. It was cute. When we said good night, I closed the door behind me in my apartment, leaned against the closed door and sighed. I was on cloud 9.		</p>

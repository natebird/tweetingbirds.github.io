				OK, so I am not doing a good job keeping up with this blog right now. August is a busy month for us now. So I'm still catching up on life. But I don't want to neglect this blog too much since it's our family journal. I will hopefully start posting stuff soon. Here's something Laney saidâ€¦</p>
<p>I was working on a birthday card for Kenzie's teacher by writing a card in calligraphy. Laney came to the table to see what I was doing then asked, "Mom, is that difficult to do?" What?! I had to turn to look at her to make sure that was a 3-year-old speaking to me.		</p>

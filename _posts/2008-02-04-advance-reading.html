				Kenzie is at that stage where she mimics whatever she sees me or Nate doing. One of my goals this year is to read 10 books by December 31. So you can find a stack of books sitting on my end table by my pillow. That's where Kenzie goes to do her advanced reading. She flips through the pages and read aloud in jibberish. She points to the pages and laugh at the funny parts in the book.</p>
<p>Here she is reading some "mama" books. She has been interested in possessions as in mom's, dad's, Kenzie's. If I am reading a magazine, Kenzie needs to have a magazine so she can point to hers and then to mine and say, "Mama."</p>
<p>Also, for some reason a few weeks ago, she started calling me mama, which I don't really prefer. Nate thinks it's funny.</p>
<p>In the first picture, Kenzie has a fake credit card in her mouth. I use those fake credit cards from junk mail as bookmarks in my books. As I read, I hold the bookmark by putting it in my mouth. I didn't noticed I did that until Kenzie started doing what she sees me doing.</p>

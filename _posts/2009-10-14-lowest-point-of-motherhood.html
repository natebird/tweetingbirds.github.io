				<b>Warning:</b> This is one of those posts that is just TMI (Too Much Info). So if you are not into poops and such, I would suggest you stop reading now. I do mean now.</p>
<p>Last week I hit probably the lowest point of motherhood, at least for me thus far. Laney had been having diarrhea for the past 2 1/2 weeks. Poor girl. Her bottom is just raw. Everything else about her is normal, happy, little girl. It's just her #2s are a bit too liquified.</p>
<p>I took her into the pediatrician last week and she checked out fine. So the doctor prescribed nystatin for her bum and told me to collect poop samples for testing. Later, the nurse came in with a nice little baggie. Four containers to fill with poop. What?! That's going to take me 3 weeks to fill. It's diarrhea for crying out loud. Everything gets absorbed into the diaper.</p>
<p>On the first day, Laney gave enough poop to fill the first one. I turned that in when I was done because they wanted it "fresh." Then it took me a couple more days to fill up the next three. I tell you… it was not a fun thing to do. The stench, the scooping with the little scooper that is attached to the container lid, the poop getting everywhere… not good. Not good at all. Especially for someone who is a bit of a germa-phobe such as I.</p>
<p>I ran the last few containers to the MD. Then they tell me it'll take about a week to get the results back. Oh great, by then she would have had the poop problem for almost a month. The amount of diapers we are going through each day… All I have to say is we are probably Pamper's #1 customer right now. Mind you, this was happening before Nate left last week for his sister's wedding, while he was gone, and still dealing with the diarrhea now that he's back.</p>
<p>On Monday, the nurse calls me back with the results from her first test… negative for whatever it was they were testing with that one. We are waiting to hear back from the rest of the tests later this week. Hopefully today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>And then, Kenzie came down with a fever last night around 7 p.m. She was complaining that she was hot and grumpy pretty much once Nate left for school. She felt a tad warm, so I took her temp - 100 degrees. Not too high, but I gave her Tylenol then sent her to bed. I tucked her in at 7:45 and had Laney down by 8. I just hope it's nothing major and that Nate and I stay healthy in the mist of these sick kids.		</p>

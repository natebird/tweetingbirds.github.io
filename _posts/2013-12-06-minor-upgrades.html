<p>
				Since we are probably not moving any time soon, I decided to make a few minor upgrades to the house. We got rid of the huge entertainment center that we got for free with along with the TV. We painted it black to make it look nicer and more fitting for our house. But then I saw that smaller entertainment center on sale at World Market and told Nate if I could get a new entertainment center then he could get a new TV. Without hesitation he said, OK! He didn't even ask to see how much the entertainment center or what it looked like. </p>
<p>Then we got new faucets for our kitchen and bathrooms. It's so great that Nate is also a handy man who could install them himself. It's the little things. </p>

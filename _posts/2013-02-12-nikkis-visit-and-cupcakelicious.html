				One of my college friends, Nikki Merrill, came down to Atlanta with her family and stayed with us for a few days. Nikki's husband was coming to Atlanta for a work conference and they all decided to come down with him. He stayed in a hotel in Atlanta, she and her two little girls stayed with us. They live in D.C. where he works as an accountant there. </p>
<p>We had a nice visit. It was so good to see Nikki again and catch up on life. We worked together at BYU's newspaper as editors. And we even took a few trips together in college. She stayed with us for almost 5 days. While she was here, we took her out to eat at the Varsity for a Georgia experience, we went swimming at the YMCA pool, she went with me to a zumba class, and then we went to a new cupcake bakery called Cupcakelicious.</p>
<p>We also took one of Kenzie's friends with us to Cupcakelicious. Kenzie and Kelsey Abbott were in the same kindergarten class and they were also in the same primary class at church. They became good friends over that year. That summer, Kelsey was moving back to Seattle where her dad had a job offer. Before Kelsey left, we took her to Cupcakelicious with us so they can hang out one last time. </p>

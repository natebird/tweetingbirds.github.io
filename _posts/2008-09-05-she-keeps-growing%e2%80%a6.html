				Kenzie is growing and learning at such a fast pace now that it's hard to keep up with her. I am trying to record her progress for future references and just a "good to know" fact.
<ul>
<li>She knows how to take off and put on her pants/shorts by herself.</li>
<li>Many things she likes to do "by myself," -- put dishes in the sink, climb up to her seat at the dinner table, sing songs, clean up.</li>
<li>She has her singing time at least once a day where she goes around singing songs and does nothing else. Good luck trying to get her to eat during her singing time. You'll get the response, "No, mom. I'm singing right now. It's singing time."</li>
<li>She knows the last word to all the sentences in her book, "Dragon in a Wagon."</li>
<li>She has us read to her, "Winnie the Pooh's Friendship Day," book at least twice a day, her reading time before nap and before bedtime. </li>
<li>She can name the following Disney princesses by looking at their pictures, Jasmine, Cinderella, Snow White, Sleeping Beauty, Ariel, and Belle. </li>
<li>Her love for "The Little Mermaid" continues to grow as she says she dreams about them every night. And memorized even more words to the song "A Part of Your World."</li>
<li>She formulates 6-8 word sentences. </li>
<li>Some big words (3+ syllables) she can say are: hippopotamus, alligator, umbrella, Kenzie, delicious, computer, Sebastian, refrigerator, xylophone, parachute, elephant, microphone, elevator, escalator.</li>
<li>EVERY TIME we get into the car, she has to listen to "Popcorn Popping." If I have the radio on or even another Primary Song Book CD in, she says, "I don't like this song, Mom. I want the popcorn song." I am so sick of listening to that song on repeat. </li>
<li>She picked up the phrase, "Oh, dear!" from her show, Super Why. So now, she uses it whenever something goes wrong. It's amazing to me how she is able to use the phrase to applicable situations without having being taught. "I made a mess, oh dear." "Oh dear, Ariel is in trouble." "I forgot my blanket, oh dear." She sounds like a distressed elderly woman when she says it.</li>
</ul>

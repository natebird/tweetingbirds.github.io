<p>Kenzie turned 19 months today and it was also her first time in nursery at church. We postponed putting her in nursery for a month because she was sick with coughing, snotty nose, and a fever for two of those weeks and just coughing and snotty nose for the last two weeks. I didn't want her to get the other nursery kids sick. Today Nate and I dropped her off in nursery and left. She did pretty good for the most part playing with the kids and the kitchen they had in there. One of the parents went in for part of the time and said Kenzie was crying for mommy. But she got over it and was fine the rest of the time. It wasn't bad enough for them to get me during class. She came out of class proudly showing her drawing of popcorn popping on the apricot tree (see picture above). When Nate asked Kenzie what she did in nursery, she answered, "Snack!" It went better than I thought it would and we'll see what it's like next week.</p>
<p>Kenzie also said the family prayer for the first time last night. Nate helped her and she repeated the last word of each sentence. It was so cute. And after lunch today while we were cleaning off the table, Kenzie had her arms folded and said, "Shhh!" She wanted to say a prayer. So I preceded to help her say a prayer and it went like this...</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> Dear Heavenly Father,<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> (silence)<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> We thank you for this day.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Day!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> We thank you we went to church.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Church!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> We thank you for letting us play with our friends.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Friends! (Then putting her finger up to her mouth while looking at daddy) Shhhh!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> We are grateful to sing songs.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Songs!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> We thank you for nusery.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Nursey!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> We thank you for letting me color pictures.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Color!<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Mommy:</span> In the name of Jesus Christ, Amen.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Amen!</p>
<p>Nate and I couldn't help but laugh when she shished us in the middle of her prayer. We're glad she likes to say prayers.		</p>

A little secret… ssshhhh… I don't actually blog every day. I actually spend a couple hours once a week writing up enough posts to last the week. Then I schedule it to be published on different days so your RSS feeds don't get cluttered with 5 posts all in one day. It also keeps you coming back. :-P</p>
<p>June has been cRaZy around here because Nate had classes four nights a week, leaving around 5 and getting home around 11. That's if he doesn't have meetings with his groups for case studies, stimulation project, or papers. Something that happens at least once a week, he leaves earlier and/or come home later. </p>
<p>We had <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/natalie-john/">visitors</a> who are now engaged. Exciting! We had gatherings with friends two weekends in a row. Then one of my YW girlie's had a <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/graduation/">high school grad</a> party. Had our carpets cleaned, which required me to leave the house with the kiddos for a few hours. Girls camp. Two-day youth conference. Youth temple trip. Missionaries over for dinner. A convert baptism. <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/gone-wild/">The zoo</a>. Making memory books for our daddies for Father's Day. Sewed <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/and-another-one/">shirt dresses</a> and <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/cowgirls/">skirts</a> for my girlies. Meetings before and after church. Fireside. Tried to keep up with other family events. Cleaned the house for guests. YW presidency meeting and class presidency meeting to plan the next three months. Going over Personal Progress to help each of my girlies catch up this summer. Having personal interviews with each YW. Attempting to put my recipes online for easy categorizing and access. Cleaned and rearranged our pantry and food storage. Lastly, <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/flashvideo-friday-sytycd/">SYTYCD</a> takes up 3 hours of my week.</p>
<p>You know it's sad when I am going home at the same time as our Bishop on a Sunday. There are Sundays when I'm at church for 7-8 hours. And when I'm not able to come home for Laney's feeding times, I have to pump a bottle for Laney before I go, then take the pump with me to pump while I am gone. Hey, I'm not complaining though. I love what I do and I love my YW. </p>
<p>Our poor kids… they have been dying for some family time. They don't see Nate during the week and I'm gone all weekend. Kenzie has been asking, "Is it Mommy's night again today?" and "Are we going to have family time with Mommy <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> Daddy?" Even Laney has been noticing we've been taking shifts with her. She is super excited to see Nate and doesn't like it when she gets the bottle more than once a day. </p>
<p>Both Nate and I are burnt out. He'll be done with his first year of MBA by the end of this semester. We're only half way through! What's funny is that in the mist of all this craziness, I have been trying to squeeze in spiritual time to enrich my spirituality. I've been reading the <a href="http://lds.org/conference/sessions/display/0,5239,23-1-1032,00.html">General Conference</a> issue of the Ensign and decided I have a lot to work on. I need to learn to be more giving and charitable. </p>
<p>For now… I'm taking deep breathes and digging into a bowl of ice cream.		</p>

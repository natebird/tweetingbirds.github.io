<p>
				We are still here. Things have been busy. And I thought I would give you a break from my daily posts for a while. Plus I needed a break.  I mentioned a little before of some of the things we were going through <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2011/09/fridays-5-at-5-we-are-alive…-barely/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/09/adapting/" target="_blank">here</a>. Apparently that was only round one of major things happening and now we are going through a second wave of "stuff" happening.</p>
<p><strong>Five weeks ago…</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Kenzie was having a hard time adjusting to being the oldest and not getting as much attention. She was expressing her frustration and feelings of neglect by having accidents and throwing tantrums.</li>
<li>Laney was loving being the big sister and wanted to hold Lai Lai all the time.</li>
<li>We found out Lai Lai has a heart stenosis, at least we were in the process of finding that out through her pediatrician and cardiologist.</li>
<li>Nate took a week off from work then worked from home for a week to help out around the house and help me adjust to being a mother of three.</li>
<li>I was not getting enough milk to nurse Lai Lai. I was having to nurse, supplement with formula then pump at each feeding. Not fun. Then the lactation nurse put me on a prescription that increased my milk supply but made me extremely drowsy (when I was already sleepy). But three weeks later I was able to feed solely on nursing and no more formula. Yay!</li>
<li>I was having a difficult time waking up in the middle of the night to feed and still function the next day.</li>
<li>Lai Lai was not on any kind of schedule. And I was beginning the training of learning to fall asleep on her own. She cried a lot.</li>
</ul>
<div><strong>These last couple of weeks…</strong></div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Nate's parents were here during fall break two weeks ago to see Lai Laiand the girls. We had such a fun time with them. More on this in later posts.</li>
<li>Kenzie is doing much better adjusting to life with two sisters. No more accidents and less tantrums.</li>
<li>Laney got sick last Wednesday with a stomach virus that caused a slight fever, diaper rash and a bunch of canker sores at the roof of her mouth. She would wake up 4-5 times at night because she couldn't suck on her thumb with the sores in her mouth. And she didn't do well at nap times either. So she would break down crying all day long.</li>
<li>Lai Lai is on a pretty good feeding schedule but not sleeping/napping. I still don't feel like she is on any kind of schedule right now. She is still learning to fall asleep on her own napping. But she is making progress as she has done it several times, just not all the time.</li>
<li>Lai Lai went in for her second cardiologist appointment and everything was great. Her echo looked good and the doctor said her stenosis was still mild. We go back again at the end of November or beginning of December for another appointment. And when I took her in for her appointment, they weighed her and she was 12 pounds at 4 weeks old. One chunky monkey. Good to know she's eating well.</li>
<li>Nate unexpectedly received a job offer by another company. And he will be switching jobs next week. More on this in a later post too.</li>
<li>My body is starting to get used to waking up in the middle of the night. I am managing life as a mom of three a little better. I am able to handle things on my own. Lai Lai sleeps from 8:30-12:30 or 1-ish. Then she wakes up again around 5-5:30 for another feeding. After feeding to 6 a.m., I get myself ready for the day and the girls wake up at 6:30 to get ready for school. Nate is gone at 6:15 for work, so the girls don't see him until he gets off work. I am usually so tired by 9 p.m. that I'm ready to pass out.</li>
<li>Nate has been busy with church and work. He has been gone a lot, usually leaving me with screaming kids. Hopefully this doesn't become the norm.</li>
</ul>

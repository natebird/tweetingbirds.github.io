				I didn't get many pictures of Easter this year. To tell you the truth, I haven't picked my camera in a while. I have been so busy working on moving existing pictures from Aperture to Lightroom that I haven't had much time to take pictures. But I did get some pictures of the Easter activity at church. Lai Lai was able to do her own egg hunt this year. </p>
<p>We kept Easter simple this year. I don't get all into the Easter bunny thing because I think it takes away from the resurrection and the meaning of Easter. Plus I don't think my girls need another holiday to get stuff. The have plenty of stuff. I did put a small pack of Legos in the older girls' bucket and a bubble gun. That's about it. Lai Lai got a movie. </p>
<p>We also didn't dye eggs (I forgot). And we didn't do a family egg hunt. They got plenty of candy from church. We also did an egg hunt at my grandma's house along with a potluck dinner on Easter Sunday with the rest of the family. The girls had an awesome time with the family and their cousins. </p>

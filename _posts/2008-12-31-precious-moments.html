				Nate was sick and went to bed early. Seeing her father in bed, Kenzie walked up to Nate on his side of the bed. She pulled up his blanket and sang "Twinkle, Twinkle Little Stars," to him like he does for her when he puts her to bed.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>Christmas morning, after partaking of a pancake breakfast, Kenzie said to Tiffany, "Good job, mom! Thank you for making me a pancake and egg breakfast."</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>In the car on the way home late one night.<br />Kenzie: Are you tired, dad and mom?<br />Tiffany: Yes, mommy is tired. Are you tired, Kenzie?<br />Kenzie: Yes, because I didn't take a nap today. How about you, dad? Are you tired?<br />Nate: Yes, daddy is tired, too.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>Sitting in her car seat looking into her purse at her Disney princesses.<br />Kenzie: Mommy, I told you not to touch my princesses in my lady bug purse.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>Kenzie drew a picture of a face on her doodle pad on the refrigerator.<br />Kenzie: Mommy, I drew a picture of you! But you have funny ears.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>Kenzie: Oh, crap.<br />Tiffany: Nate, did you hear what your daughter just said?<br />Nate: Kenzie, you are not supposed to say that word. And daddy is not supposed to say that word either, OK?<br />Kenzie: OK.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>In the car on the way home.<br />Kenzie: This Chapstick is tasty.<br />Tiffany: You're not supposed to eat Chapstick, Kenzie.<br />Kenzie: Yeah, because it doesn't taste good.<br />Tiffany: [looking back to see Kenzie applied Chapstick to her face and legs by digging it out with her fingers.] You have Chapstick all over you, huh?<br />Kenzie: It's on my fingers, too. Get the Chapstick off my fingers! Now my hand is dirty.</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>Kenzie: [a random comment] I don't like my breathing treatments.<br />Tiffany: You're healthy now and you don't need to do your breathing treatments anymore.<br />Kenzie: Yeah, only daddy is sick now. Hahaha! [Evil laugh]</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*  *  *</div>
<p>Kenzie: Laney is my baby sister and she sleeps in a crib.<br />Tiffany: You know, Laney is not here yet.<br />Kenzie: She is almost here.		</p>

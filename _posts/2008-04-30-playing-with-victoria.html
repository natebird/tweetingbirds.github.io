				We are so grateful to Grant and Kelly Memmott who let us stay at their house Friday night, even though the original plan was to stay there Friday and Saturday night. They were so nice accommodating our schedules and allowing us to change plans on them at the last second. We wished we had more time to spend with them since the last time we saw the Memmotts was November 2006 when Victoria and Kenzie were a lot smaller and back when they lived in Charlotte, North Carolina.</p>
<p>Kenzie and Victoria (four months older) hit it off well and became best friends in such a sort time. Kenzie enjoyed playing with all of Victoria's cool toys, watching movies with her, and playing ring around the rosy. The girls were too cute together, we had to get a bunch of pictures.</p>

<p>Victoria and Kenzie back in November of 2006 when the Memmotts visited us at our home. We miss having them in the South.</p>

<p>The girls now, so much bigger! And they both had to play with the same cell phones, luckily we had two of the same phone.</p>

<p>They loved playing ring around the rosy together and did that several times Saturday morning.</p>

<p>Kenzie loved riding Victoria's horse and it was a great opportunity to teach them about taking turns.</p>

<p>They had to do everything together, including playing the piano, eating snacks, going upstairs, and going back downstairs.</p>

<p>Kenzie and cool Victoria best friends forever, and if they are not, their parents will make them BFFs. :)		</p>

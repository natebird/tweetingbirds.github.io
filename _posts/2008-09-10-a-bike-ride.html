				I bought this blue and pink bike with training wheels for Kenzie on Labor Day. Last Saturday, we decided to bring it out and let her try it. We're still working on getting her to ride by herself. She's in her pajamas in the pictures because she loves to lounge around in her pjs all day long. It's a challenge trying to get her to change into regular clothes.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SMfpn8D4sLI/AAAAAAAAChI/pebTuwIhtHE/s1600-h/IMG_9033.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9033.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244417163442827442" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SMfpn5Q1c5I/AAAAAAAAChQ/sBy7-LPlnWs/s1600-h/IMG_9035.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9035.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5244417162691834770" /></a>		</p>

<p>I finally made it happen. It has been embarrassingly long time since Nate and I have been to the temple together and did a session. That's why this made it on my list of things I wanted to do before I turn 30. We went to a Saturday 9 a.m. session on Jan. 19, the Saturday before the temple closed for two weeks for cleaning. This meant Nate and I got up a little before 6 a.m., got ourselves ready, got the kids dressed and fed, loaded the car and off to my parents' house we went. My parents watched the girls for half the day while we were at the temple. It was nice. Felt the spirit really strong and learned new things. Such a great atmosphere and feeling when going to the temple. Afterwards Nate and I were able to talk about what we learned and how we can both improve our lives. We also went out to lunch at a different sushi restaurant. This one was much better than the last one we went to. And then ice cream afterwards at Cold Stone. The girls had a great time at my parents. They were good and played with all these new toys my mom had got them from yard sales. So yeah, definitely making more of an effort to go more often to the temple. </p>
<p>I actually went to the temple again for our stake temple week. Such great and wonderful spiritual experiences. I love the temple!		</p>

				It was so nice that Nate's dad, Randy, helped us with house projects during his visit here. Part of it was because he wanted projects to keep him busy and part of it was because we needed the help and his expertise. This time he helped us install a track light in my kitchen and move the old kitchen fluorescent light into the garage. Now my kitchen looks awesome producing more of a home feel rather than a commercial atmosphere as with the fluorescent light. And now we have a nice bright fluorescent light in the garage rather than the single lonely light bulb that used to be there.</p>
<p>Since I got my track lighting at Home Depot on such a steal, on clearance for $21 (regular price of $49), I had some extra money left on my Home Depot gift card to get a can of black paint for the entertainment center in our living room. We got the entertainment center for free, along with the TV in it. And ever since we got it, we have been meaning to paint it black to match the rest of our living room. A year later, we finally did it! It looks so good now that it's finished! I am so excited about my kitchen and living room now! Thank you, Randy, for all your help and Cyndi for watching Kenzie while we painted allowing us to finish faster!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R88FzgcNdrI/AAAAAAAABjc/A3r9wmN8nlg/s1600-h/IMG_0262.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0262.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5174360879311713970" /></a><br />Nate putting up the fluorescent light in the garage.</p>

You can see its original oak color.</p>

But it actually worked out fine without the primer on the backs of the entertainment center.</p>

				Kenzie doesn't nap much anymore. Maybe once a week, if that. Well, a couple weeks ago, she actually took a nap during quiet time. Laney woke up from her nap before Kenzie. She usually just runs around or more likely, hang out with mom. But this time was different. She was goneâ€¦ and quiet. It's never a good sign when they girls are quiet. So Nate checked out what the girls were doing and found this. Laney snuggled up next to Kenzie on her bed. Way too cute. I love these tender sisterly moments. Makes me wish I had a sister.</p>

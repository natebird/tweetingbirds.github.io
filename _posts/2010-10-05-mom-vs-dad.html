				Kenzie: Mom, I want <em>you</em> to read me a story again.</p>
<p>Tiffany: You want me to read you and story? What about dad?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I don't want daddy to read me a story.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Why don't you want daddy to read you a story?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Because some times he does it wrong and some times he does it right.</p>
<p>Tiffany: How does daddy read a story wrong?</p>
<p>Kenzie: He makes up the story.		</p>

				And I'm back. Took a few weeks off because we were just plain busy. A lot to catch up on so I'll get right to it. I'm excited for this year. We don't have much planned yet for 2012. It should be an exciting year though. I haven't had much time to think about 2012.</p>
<p>We didn't do anything for New Year's Eve or New Year because the kiddos were sick. We had lots of plans for those couple of days but had to cancel on all of them. Our friends were having New Year's Eve party Saturday night and we had a game night planned with some other friends. But the sick kids needed us at home to take care of them and we didn't want them to spread their germs to others. Nate and I tried to make the best out of it even though we didn't have much time to plan anything fun. So we stayed up and played a game just the two of us. But we were both so tired that we were asleep before the new year rang in.</p>
<p>This time of the year always make us reflect what has happened the past year. We have had so many blessings in 2011. It is just incredible how much Heavenly Father has blessed our little family. And the only way to give back to Him is to do what we are supposed to do and help others. This year I am recommitting to be more charitable.</p>
<p>Here's to a happy 2012!		</p>

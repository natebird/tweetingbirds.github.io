				Back in April we registered Kenzie for kindergarten. I know, crazy. I am trying not to think about it. But I was actually pretty calm at the school registration. Nate on the other hand started having a mid-life crisis freak out during the middle of it. He started questioning his life, "What am I doing here? Who am I? Why do I have a child who will be going to school soon?" Kenzie had to take a little assessment test so they can place her in the right class. She did very well the teacher said. She was reading and writing to the teacher. Laney wanted to be a part of everything Kenzie was doing, of course. Laney and I will both have a hard time when Kenzie is in school.		</p>

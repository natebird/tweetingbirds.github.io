				Laney: Mom, I wish Barron could be alive because I miss him a lot.<br />
Kenzie: yeah. I miss him a lot too.<br />
Laney: Irene miss him a lot too. But that's OK. Jesus can heal him and he will be alive again.</p>
<p>Another instance I was explaining to Laney that they are building an assisted living next to our neighborhood.<br />
Laney: Mom, who will live there?<br />
Tiffany: Old people who need extra help. They can't live by themselves anymore because they have health problems. So they need extra help from nurses and other people.<br />
Laney: Oh, I know! Jesus can also help them and heal them. 		</p>

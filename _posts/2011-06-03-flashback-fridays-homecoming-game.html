<p>After the first date everything was smooth sailing from there, right? Unfortunately, no. Things were going great for a while. Nate and I spent a lot of time together, just about every day. I did give him a curfew, not because I was a lame duck. But because I had dance practice at 6 a.m. every morning. Which meant I had to get up at 5 a.m. or earlier to get ready for classes after dance practice. That's rough in the fall/winter months in Utah. And if you know me, you know I'm not a morning person. So at 9 p.m. each night we parted ways so I can get some homework done and go to sleep at a decent hour. I need about 8 hours of sleep to be a happy camper the next day. Didn't happen often in college, it was more 5 hours of sleep each night. But I had to at least give it a try. Nate was fine with is because he was able to go home and hang out with the guys (Jeff, Braden and Grant).</p>
<p>So we went on our first date on Tuesday, then that Thursday was Homecoming at BYU. Unfortunately BYU football was horrible that year. But our friend, Jeff, got us good seats at the game, the second row right behind the BYU football bench. Jeff was in the ROTC and was doing the canons that night (they blew the canons each time BYU scored, which wasn't much that night). And when you are in ROTC, you can get your friends great tickets pretty much down at the field. So a bunch of us were going to the game together.</p>
<p>Earlier that day, I received an unexpected phone call from Ryan. He wanted to meet me so we could talk. It had been about two weeks since Ryan and I parted ways. I didn't think it was a good idea to meet up, but Ryan insisted it was urgent and had to be in person. So after work, I met him before my class. We met on campus and we just sat outside somewhere to talk. He said he missed me and he had been thinking a lot about me and our relationship. He went on for a while then he got to the point. He said the had been discussing things with his parents. And he realized that he <em>was</em> in love with me and that he <em>did</em> want to marry me. So he asked me to marry him. What?! I was quite taken back by that questions. Totally unexpected. His plans were we could get married before he left for medical school the next year. And I can transfer to finish school in Arizona where he was going to medical school. Then he added that his parents came down from Idaho to meet me and to go to the Homecoming game. Yikes. I didn't quite know how to respond to that. I did end up meeting his mom, but not his dad.</p>
<p>After that initial shock, I told him that I would have to think about it. I was going to fast about it and get back to him later. Then Ryan asked if I was seeing someone else. I couldn't lie to him, so I said yes, but it was nothing serious. We've only been on a date. But the fact of the matter was I wasn't choosing Ryan or Nate. My choice was whether I should marry Ryan. Nate had nothing to do with that, especially since we had just started dating. Ryan was upset about that. He couldn't believe I was already dating someone else when we had broken up only two weeks ago. It wasn't like I was planning on dating someone so soon. And Ryan couldn't believe I didn't say yes right away. So he asked me to go with him and his parents to the Homecoming game that night. I told him I couldn't. Then he responded that his parents were planning on taking us out to dinner and going to the football game together. Well, I already had plans. I didn't want to be mean, but I had already made plans with Nate and I wasn't sure I wanted to be with Ryan at that time. I was still trying to comprehend what had just happened.</p>
<p>After my conversation with Ryan, I had missed my class so I called Julia and Jeff. I had to talk to them about what had just happened. Then I called my dad for some fatherly advice. I totally needed that. And lastly, I went to my Uncle Max who lived in Orem. He was a patriarch and I had gone to him many times before for advice and help. Max gave me a blessing then he counseled me. It was wise counsel and I took it to heart. Finally, I texted Nate and told him I needed to talk to him before the football game.</p>
<p>Nate picked me up for the football game and we walked to the football stadium going through Helaman Halls. We stopped at a bench outside to talk. This was the first time I was telling Nate about Ryan. I didn't go into details. Just got to the point and told Nate that Ryan had asked me to marry him. I thought Nate would say, "Forget this girl. She obviously has a lot of baggage." Then take off. But Nate reacted just the opposite. He was calm and supportive of whatever decision I made. He said it was my choice and he would be fine either way. Plus we had only been dating for a week. Nothing major. I was surprised by his reaction to the situation, in a good way. We continued on to the football game and that entire evening, Nate treated me the same as if nothing had happened. He wasn't going out of his way to try to convince me not to marry Ryan. Nor did he ignore me because my ex had asked me to marry him that day.</p>
<p>That night I prayed pretty intensely. And I had been fasting since my conversation with Ryan. I tossed and turned that night. The next morning, Friday, came and I skipped dance practice. I had too much on my mind and didn't get much sleep the night before. I went to work with one thing on my mind. While I was at work, Ryan called me. He said he couldn't sleep the night before. He had to know what I was thinking. So I told him I would meet him after work. It was a pretty intense day.</p>
<p>After work I met with Ryan. We talked. And after a while, I told him I had been praying and fasting. And marrying him didn't feel like the right thing to do. Ryan cried and I cried. It was quite emotional. We spend the next few hours talking. First he wanted to know what he could do so we could be together. Toward the end of our conversation we mostly said our good byes. I thought it would be best if we would not see or talk to each other for a while. Ryan walked me to my next class and then he was gone.</p>
<p>When my class was over, I called Nate. Told him what happened. And I couldn't remember much of what happened after the rest of the day. It was all a blur and it seemed like it was a dream.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that wasn't the end of Ryan. About a week later, he waited for me outside a class (he knew my class schedule) because he wanted to talk to me. He tried to convince me to marry him and give him a second chance. So I had to tell him no, all over again. After that, we had a few random run-ins with Ryan on campus and at a mutual friend's wedding reception. But other than that, that was pretty much the end of Ryan. We had a few run-ins with Ryan - bound to happen since we were still all going to school at BYU.</p>

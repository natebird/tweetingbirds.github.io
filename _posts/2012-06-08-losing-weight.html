<p>I have a goal to lose 20 pounds by the time we go to Disney. But I'm not doing any gimmicks. Just watching what I eat and exercising. I have an app on my phone where I keep track of my calorie intake for the day. Then I work out three times a day at the YMCA. It has been about a month and I have noticed a little difference. My arms and belly are toning up a little bit. I still have a lot to work on, but I have lost 5 pounds in about a month. Losing 20 pounds would get me back to my weight before I had babies. Let's hope I can keep this up. I enjoy working out in classes. And watching my calories is not too bad. I am supposed to consume 1700 calories a day to lose about a pound a week. It is hard to see the weight drop slowly. When losing weight you always want quick results. But since this is a lifestyle change, it takes time. 15 more pounds to go!		</p>

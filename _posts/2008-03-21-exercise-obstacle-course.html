				I started my goal of exercising and getting in shape today. The motivation kicked in when I went out shopping for some summer clothes and all the shirts I tried on emphasized my nice muffin top all around my waist area. So sad! I have had a hard time adjusting to post pregnancy body. First of all, I gained 45 pounds during pregnancy carrying a 9 pound baby. That stretched my belly out much far past my limit where I have stretch marks ALL over my belly. They are still there, just not as purple as it used to be. Then, after the baby and with the help of nursing, I was able to drop 35 pounds within the first 8 months. But I am still lingering on to the last 10 pounds. The most difficult part of it all is the flabbiness of my abs. I am NOT USED TO THAT! I know I have more than 10 pounds there. My abs are just made out of a different substance now. It's worse when I sit down and it is more visible.</p>
<p>So I am working it off. Being a mother, I am naturally prone to walk around the house, up and down our stairs, and go for walks outside all day long as weather permits. But now, I need to take it up to the next level of activity rate. This is my plan of action. My choice form of exercise includes aerobics, dancing, kickboxing, tae bo, and playing sports. I am not one of those who goes to the gym to lift weights, run a treadmill, or go running around the neighborhood. I hate running. So this morning, I signed up for Netflix's free trial so I can rent all the fitness videos to try them out to find out which ones I like to do. I should be getting the first four by Monday. I'm excited! I'll keep you up on my progress.</p>
<p>Since my Netflix fitness videos won't get in until Monday, I started this morning with a step aerobic DVD I already own. It's a 30 minute video and during that time I stepped on Kenzie 3 times. I pulled out her little step stool and set it next to my step. That didn't work since she was more intrigued by mine because it is bigger and it looks like the ones they have in the video. Since I was using it, she got bored and started bringing toys into my exercising space. I didn't noticed until I stepped on them during my workout. I guess she thought my exercise was much too easy without an obstacle course set up all around it. In the MIDDLE of my exercise, I snapped this picture.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R-PYfE_HdKI/AAAAAAAABsk/5r9HJKdSN64/s1600-h/IMG_7814.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7814.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5180222024832218274" /></a>		</p>

<p>
				Our Laney is growing up so quickly already. I am trying to cherish moments with her. It's hard balancing getting things done, spending time with Kenzie, spending time with Laney, spending time with Nate, and having some alone time to myself. Time to myself usually results in sleep at night.</p>
<p>Laney is becoming more and more alert during the day. She likes watching the baby mobiles in the crib and the swing. She has such a happy spirit all the time. She rarely cries unless she is hungry or tired. She has a bit of acid reflux. The pediatrician prescribed her a prescription, but I don't give it to her all the time, only when she needs it. We have her sleep in her car seat all the time because it keeps her upright and helps with the acid reflux. She will also turn when she hears your voice. She is fitting her newborn clothes well and will soon be moving into the 3-month sizes. She sleeps 4 hours at night. We are working on having her fall asleep on her own.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SbGh5U_WGjI/AAAAAAAAEOY/n72GJAcFjHY/s1600-h/IMG_9887.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9887.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5310203441905539634" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SbGh5MLlz_I/AAAAAAAAEOQ/myNIxrDLiPY/s1600-h/IMG_9882.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9882.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5310203439540981746" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SbGh5C4thdI/AAAAAAAAEOI/rZkxCzXgOek/s1600-h/IMG_0013.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0013.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5310203437045876178" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SbGh42Qb_GI/AAAAAAAAEOA/IBXGQxMy3PM/s1600-h/IMG_0012.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0012.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5310203433655729250" /></a>		</p>

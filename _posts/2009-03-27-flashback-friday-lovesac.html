				We have a LoveSac. For our wedding, Nate's aunts and uncles all chipped in money for us to get a bean bag. We decided we wanted a LoveSac. Since we wanted the good stuff, it also cost a good bit of pocket change. The money from his aunts and uncles didn't quite cover it. Luckily, we also received wedding money from the family I nannied for in NYC, and we waited for a LoveSac coupon that came out in a local Utah magazine.</p>
<p>It was an exciting day when we made our first big furniture purchase together, the SuperSac. Can you believe it was once so small that it came in a duffle bag? We brought it home, gave it much love and air, and it grew. It kept growing over the next few days. Soon it took up about half the living room of our small Union Square apartment.</p>
<p>The LoveSac is a huge hit with the kids. I just wish we had a basement to put it.</p>

<p>I was first introduced to LoveSac when my college roomies and I visited apartment #221 at Carriage Cove- Jeff, Amen, Jeramie, and Tyler's apartment. Tyler had a navy blue one. Because of that cool LoveSac, my roomies and I decided to be friends with them. :) Lots of great memories with those guys… lots of great memories in that apartment… lots of great memories with that LoveSac.		</p>

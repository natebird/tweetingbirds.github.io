				Kenzie has her favorite yellow blanket. It has been her favorite yellow blankie since she was about a year old. She used to call it Night Night.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, are you excited that Dudepa and Puo Puo are coming over?<br />Kenzie: Yes, but Puo Puo calls my blanket Night Night. I'm too old to call my blanket Night Night. I call it blanket now.		</p>

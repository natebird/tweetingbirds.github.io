				Memorial Day we went to the pool and had a cook out with the family. It was simple but fun. This was Lai Lai's first time in the pool and she loved it. I thought she was the cutest baby in swimsuit that day. I mean look at all those rolls. Way too adorable.</p>
<p>That morning Nate worked in the yard and got stung by yellow jackets. That poor guy. And he also found an egg of some sort. Laney kept hoping it would hatch. Unfortunately she cracked the egg before the end of the day. The best part was the day ended with a rainbow. Couldn't have been more perfect.</p>

<ul>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She says mom, more, dad, that, what, hello, bye, oops, down, hot, uh oh.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Loves to talk on the phone. She puts it under her cheeks and says hello and chats away. Especially to Puo Puo and Grandma.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She loves to wear her sisters' shoes or dress up shoes, even ones with heels. One time she tried to wear Nate's shoes.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She also likes to accessorize with necklaces. Just like her sisters.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She is the jokester in the family, thinks she is so funny. She does things to make people laugh.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She is such a good girl to cuddle with.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She is a mommy's girl. Prefers me over anyone else and wants me in her sight at all times.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She loves her sisters and loves to play with them. Although at times that means she grabs whatever it is they are playing with and runs away. Not that she wanted to play with it, just because she can and to get a reaction.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;"> </span><span style="line-height: 13px;">She is very friendly to kids her age and loves to play with them and give them hugs. All my other girls always liked playing with older kids. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She is very sympathetic. When her sisters are crying, she goes and gives them kisses and hugs and asks them if they are OK. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She folds her arms for prayer. It's so cute. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She climbs up on things now. Wants to be up with everyone else. She loves to climb up on the table and get into stuff.</span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She is really smart and understands and comprehends a lot. She can follow instructions from us. One time Nate was singing <em>Rock a Bye Baby</em> and she went and got a electronic book toy, turned to the page that sang that song. That was before she turned 1. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">She doesn't like the taste of milk. I stopped nursing her after Disney but can't seem to get her to drink cow's milk or any kind of milk. </span></li>
<li><span style="line-height: 13px;">Such a cute and fun girl. Love to her pieces. </span></li>
</ul>

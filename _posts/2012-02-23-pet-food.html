				Kenzie: Maybe one day we will have a pet fish. And when it dies, we can eat it.</p>
<p>Tiffany made a "gross!" face.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Don't worry, we'll take out the bones.</p>
<p>Lately Kenzie has been asking to get a fish for a pet. And I feel especially bad for Laney because she loves animals and pets, especially dogs. However, our kids will never have a pet. I am too OCD to have an animal in the house. And I do not care to take care of it or feed it or pay for it. I would rather spend the money, time and my efforts toward my children.		</p>

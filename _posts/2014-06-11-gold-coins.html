<p>I took Nora in for her 2 month wellness check and had Laney and Lai Lai with me. On our way out, I had Nora in a stroller and Laney and Lai Lai took off in front of me toward the long hallway to the exit. They were slowed down by an adorable elderly couple. The husband walking slowly using a walker and his wife beside him. The wife heard my girls coming and she told her husband to move aside. He stopped to move aside so the girls and I can get by with the stroller. The girls kept going ahead of me. And the husband seeing the three girls told his wife to get his coin purse out of his pocket. She stopped me and told me they have something for the girls. I thought perhaps he had some candy or something for the girls. The husband then told his wife to get out coins for the girls. The wife then asked me if I wanted to them to give it to the girls or to me since the girls ran off and were already waiting at the exit doors. I said I would take it to them. She handed me three gold coins. She said, "These are gold coins that he gives to good girls and boys." I thanked her and had to leave to catch up to the other girls so they don't go out the exit door and into the parking lot without me. </p>
<p>Once I caught up to the girls, I looked at the coins and realized they were real gold coins. Not candy or anything. They were presidential coins the U.S. made for each president of the United States. It's one of those collectors coins. I showed the girls the coins and they thought it was cool. I got the feeling that I should go back and have the girls say thank you to the couple. How sweet of them to give little kids gold coins?! The girls ran back to the couple and said thank you and gave them hugs. It was really cute. I wished I had gotten my phone camera out in time to get a picture. This couple were so nice to do such a nice gesture. And they said to me how blessed I was to have three beautiful girls. I didn't tell them I had another one at school. But it really touched my heart that there are some genuine people out there. 		</p>

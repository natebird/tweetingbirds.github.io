				I was tired by this time from our travels that by the time that Easter came around, I was not into doing a holiday. So I didn't do anything special for the girls other than get them new dresses for Easter. No toys, no candy. We didn't need the extra sugar or toys in the house. Nate dyed eggs and decorated it with the girls. We went to our ward Easter activity. And on Easter Sunday we went to my grandparents' house for a potluck and a small egg hunt for the girls indoor. The yard was wet outside from rain all the days before Easter. And since my girls were the only kids there that day, they just did a little egg hunt for them. They were fine with that. I had Nora in her Easter dress with a onesie under the dress since it was sleeveless. Once we got to church, she blew out of her diaper and I had to ditch the onesie. At least it didn't get on the dress. She does that a lot at church. I know, I was the Easter Grinch this year. </p>

<div style="text-align: justify;">I think it is because I am at home with her all the time that Kenzie is starting to pick up on some of my habits and quirkiness. So here's my list of why my child is turning into a mini me.</div>
<div></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">13.</span></span> This one is a given, but we both love Nate! The best time of our day is when Nate comes home and we can all snuggle up with him.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">12.</span> </span>Kenzie is cautious and careful. She lives the motto, "Better safe than sorry." That is why we don't have a problem with her going up and down our steep set of stairs. </div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">11.</span></span> <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:medium;">Kenzie inherit the need to dance from her mom. We have dance time every day. She picked up a few new moves -- twirling, shaking, bouncing, and running in place.</span></div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">10. </span></span>Kenzie has a <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">love</span> for shoes and purses. She already has a collection of 5 or 6 pairs of shoes, thanks to her mom! She loves to wear cute shoes to match her outfits. And she also loves to carry around my purses. </div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">9.</span></span> Kenzie is turning into quite the shopper. She likes to walk around the stores and pull things off the shelves. But at least I put my items in the cart whereas she put items on the floor. And she is easily distracted in the stores by things with puppies or dog pictures on it. She also likes to push around shopping carts.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">8.</span></span> Kenzie has a creative side that she definitely didn't inherit from her father. She loves to color and draw and create things out of nothing. And I highly encourage creativity.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">7.</span></span> Kenzie and I both share a devoted passion for ice cream. She knows what it is and she knows where to get it.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">6.</span></span> Kenzie and I both think we are funny. We like to make people laugh with sarcastic humor. People laugh, but we're not sure if it with us or at us...</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">5.</span></span> Kenzie loves to pretend she is cooking and feeding her "children" consisting of her stuffed animals. She would cook, and often offer to help me cook dinner, if I would just let her get on top of the kitchen counters. But at her age (16 months), I think that's a bit early to be playing on the stove top. Maybe next year. (OK, see, there's the sarcastic humor.)</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">4.</span></span> We are both night owls. We can stay up late and sleep in late. Lately, Kenzie has been sleeping in until around 9 or 10 in the morning. Which allows me to sleep in, too! Nate is just the opposite.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">3.</span></span> Kenzie likes to organize things. Today we were at the library and she felt impelled to rearrange the children's books on display. I guess they weren't in her preferred order. And she often goes through my pantry or cupboards in the kitchen and rearranges the pots and pans, tupperware, etc. Those of you close to me know I have an obsession with organization, but I like to see it more as a hobby.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">2.</span></span> At such a young age of 15 months, Kenzie found a talent for cleaning. She likes to get out the rags, disinfecting wipes, and a bottle of lotion that she pretends is some form of cleaning product from a cabinet next to the kitchen sink and go at it mopping the floors in the kitchen. If she spills something in the kitchen, we can ask her to get a towel and wipe it up and she actually does it! She also helps out with putting dishes away, picking up her toys as she sways to the "Clean Up" song, and doing the laundry.</div>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">1.</span></span> Neither one of us can function without our calendars and to do lists. When I am going over my planner, Kenzie like to take it out of my hands, along with the pencil, and write things she likes to do in my calendar. And the same thing happens when I am going over my to do lists. I guess she is a busy girl with things on her agenda, so she wants to make sure it gets done. But best of all, we are both multi-taskers. Just watch her play and you'll see she's got more than one thing going on at once.</div>

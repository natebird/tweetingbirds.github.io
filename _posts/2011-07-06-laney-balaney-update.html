<p>This girl is at the cutest age 2 1/2. I love it when they are around 2-3 years old.</p>
<ul>
<li>Nicknames… Cutesy Lane, Lang Lang, Laney Balaney, Alaina Lane, Laina, Cutesy Bum.</li>
<li>She's got a streak of stubbornness in her. She is firm in what she wants.</li>
<li>She wants to wear her pink princess heart pajamas all day. The only other thing she wants to wear are her fancier church dresses. No interest in any other clothes.</li>
<li>She is still sucking on that thumb.</li>
<li>She is ready for potty training, but I'm waiting until after the baby comes since we will be traveling again in a few weeks. I don't want to travel in the middle of potty training.</li>
<li>She tells us when she pees or poops (although most of the time she call them both poop). And sometimes she tells us before she pees that she needs to go to the bathroom. But when we put her on, she doesn't do anything until after we put her diaper back on. She has only pee and pooped in potty once each.</li>
<li>She is doing better pronouncing her words, but still need some work.</li>
<li>She loves to talk and sing songs.</li>
<li>Everyone says she looks like me but she has lots of Nate's features… her eyes, eyebrows, toes, hair color.</li>
<li>Her favorite color is now pink. And she loves all things princesses and girly. She still likes trains and cars and balls, but not as much as princess stuff.</li>
<li>She has a little beanie dog that she loves as much as her Hello Kitty doll. She treats it like her pet dog. She loves dogs and puppies.</li>
<li>She is getting picky with her food. And at meal times, she sits at the table for a little while then says she's done so she can go play. But she doesn't eat all her food and gets hungry later.</li>
<li>She wants to do whatever mom is doing. She pulls a chair to the kitchen counter when I am eating. She sits in my lap when I am on the computer. She climbs on the table to watch me sew and tries to "help".</li>
<li>She loves to snuggle with mom. And she still prefers me over Nate for now. I enjoy it.</li>
<li>Every time Nate is gone, she assumes he is at work or at church. And 95 percent of the time she is right.</li>
<li>She wants to do things on her own and likes to be in control of things. If she thinks you are trying to take control away from her she will fight you on it.</li>
<li>She likes to figure things out on her own - buckle in her car seat, climbing to the top bunk, opening doors, etc.</li>
<li>For a while there she was getting out of her bed. But now she's doing much better since we started locking her door. Now we don't need to lock any more. We just have a problem with her climbing into Kenzie's bed at night and falling asleep with Kenzie.</li>
<li>She loves to dance. She is so excited to be taking a ballet dance class this summer.</li>
<li>She still naps 2 hours in the afternoons.</li>
<li>Starting to memorize Disney Princess songs and reading her alphabet and numbers.</li>
</ul>

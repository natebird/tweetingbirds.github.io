				I took the girls Christmas shopping for their sisters. I went with Laney first. We went to the Scholastic warehouse book sale. She bought books for each of her sisters. Then we went out to eat at her favorite restaurant, Chick-Fil-A. </p>
<p>Next I took Kenzie shopping another day. We went to a few stores for her to find the right gifts for her sisters. This year was the first year we actually had the girls buy gifts for each other. Previous years they were too young to do so. Lai Lai didn't buy gifts for her sisters because she's too young. It was exciting for the girls to choose a gift they knew their sister would like, wrap it and watch them open it on Christmas morning. I had a great time with each girl. Now I got to think of something to do with Lai Lai for our one-on-one time. </p>
<p>And finally, still during the Christmas break, Kenzie and Laney had a play date with some friends. So I took that opportunity to go out with Lai Lai. We just ran errands at Target. Shopped around. I let her let loose in the toy section for a while. And then I grabbed a few things on clearance and that we needed. We tried on some shoes for her, which she loved. She's into shoes right now.</p>

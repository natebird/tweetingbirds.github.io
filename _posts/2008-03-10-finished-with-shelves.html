				In my previous post, I posted a picture of our entertainment mostly finished. It didn't have the shelves in because I was still working on finishing it after Nate's parents had left. I had to do the surfaces one day and the edges another day after the surfaces dried. Then we finally put it all back together on Saturday and this is what it looks like now... so much better! Now I am trying to get a toy chest made by my grandpa so I can get rid of all of Kenzie's toys on the entertainment center.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R9WF1h1qI_I/AAAAAAAABks/2WkTFy6Prvg/s1600-h/IMG_7636.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7636.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5176190501395244018" /></a>		</p>

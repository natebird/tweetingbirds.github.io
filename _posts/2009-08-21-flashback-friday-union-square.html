I have only been blogging on a consistent level since December 2007, so anything before that hasn't been recorded for our family history purposes.

<div>Today's flashback is of our apartment in Provo. Nate and I were married the spring of 2005. We both had our last year of college left at Brigham Young University. I did school through spring and summer semesters my junior and senior years to finish in 4 years. Nate was on the 5-year plan with a LDS mission after his freshmen year. It turned out well that we both had a year left. </div>
<div></div>
<div>After marriage, we moved into Union Square apartments. Not knowing much of what to expect for married housing at BYU, we tried to look for something close to campus and cheap. We applied for Wymount but got put on a waiting list. Rather than taking our chances, we just signed a contract with Union Square. It wasn't anything awesome, but it was decent. </div>
<div></div>
<div>We were in an awesome ward. The ward consisted of half the residents of Union Square. The other half were in a separate ward. That made visiting and home teaching very easy since you only had go down a few apartments to visit. Since it was a one-bedroom apartment, the ward didn't have primary, nursery, or youths. It was like the singles ward, but no one was spouse hunting. </div>

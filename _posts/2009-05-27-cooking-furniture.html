				Kenzie: [noticed the beds in her doll house were missing] Mom, where are the princesses' beds?<br />Tiffany: I don't know. Where can they be?<br />Kenzie: [looking at her kitchen set in the playroom] They are in the oven. Somebody cooked them.</p>
<p>That somebody she was referring to was her friend, Christian, who was here on Monday to play with her. Our friends, Alan and Tamara, came over on Memorial Day for a cookout. First time using the grill this summer. It was nice to take that cover off and smell the grill heating up. Alan and Tamara have two boys, both a month apart from our two girls. </p>
<p>Kenzie and Christian played well together, although Kenzie wasn't quite sure how to play with boys. So she did what any 2 1/2-year-old princess would do. She ran around the house calling Christian Prince Philip (from Sleeping Beauty) and herself Princess Aurora. "Prince Philip, come follow me." "Prince Philip got tied up." Christian, not understanding the princess pretend play, didn't care much about being Prince Philip. He just looked at Kenzie like she's weird to following him around the house calling him Prince Philip and asking him to get tied up. It was pretty funny to watch.</p>
<p>Laney and Miles, their youngest son, laid around and drooled the whole time. </p>
<p>Unfortunately, I handed Nate the camera and he took one blurry picture of Kenzie jumping in the puddles. No pictures of our guests or Christian and Kenzie playing. That's why I'm the family photographer.		</p>

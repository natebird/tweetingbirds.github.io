				Thanks to our local library, I checked out the park pass that gave us a free pass for a family of four (we're a family of four nowâ€¦ crazy huh?!) to any of the state parks. We are lucky to live by so many beautiful state parks here in the South. Since Nate's spring break zipped right past, we didn't have much time to have fun together as a family. So last Saturday, just a day before his spring break ended, I was determined to have at least one family outing.</p>
<p>What did Nate do during spring break? He worked on his website for his business and did homework until odd hours of the night. When he wasn't busy with that, he watched the girlies while I had Young Women and Relief Society activities, events, and meetings. Fun spring break, huh?</p>
<p>Anyway, back on subject. Saturday morning, Nate worked. I wasn't sure if he was going to finish in time for our outing. But he stopped around 10:30 a.m., I packed a quick lunch of PB&J;, and we packed the rest of baby/toddler gear for the 30 minute trip to the park.</p>
<p>We had a great time for the 2 hours we were there. We walked a short paved trail that outlined the lake. It was a gorgeous sunny day, a tad bit windy in the shade. Kenzie insisted on bringing her stroller to push her princesses. At the end of the day, Kenzie said she had fun. That's all that matters.</p>

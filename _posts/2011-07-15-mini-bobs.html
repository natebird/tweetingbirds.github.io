<p>I guess I haven't posted about the girls' haircuts. I have a hard time remembering what I posted on here and what I posted on Simply Modern Mom. Well, back in May I chopped off the girls' long locks of hair. The evening of Kenzie's dance recital, I gave them both haircuts for the summer. And Nate got in line to have his hair cut that night too. Laney's bob was getting long, so I just shortened it to her chin.</p>

<p>But Kenzie, she had really long hair. And her hair is like mine, black, heavy and thick. So I started out cutting off about 6 inches then eventually shortened it to her chin which turned out to be about 10 inches that I cut off. Since it's so thick, I thinned it out a little and I gave her bangs. It's nice to be able to brush her hair without all the tangles. And this is super low maintenance. She still looks cute, especially when she puts a headband in it.</p>

<p>I am obviously not one of those moms who is attached to hair. I'm not like that with my hair either. I have no problem with chopping hair off.</p>

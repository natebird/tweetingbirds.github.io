				The last few weeks of school we realized that Kenzie was having a hard time seeing far away. So after we got back from the beach, I set up an appointment for her with the eye doctor. We went in and yup! She needed glasses. Unfortunately she got my eyes rather than Nate's who has perfect 20/20 vision. We picked out her glasses and she was all good to go. I decided to spend a bit more and get her glasses that she liked and looked good on her rather than cheap ones that didn't look as good on her. Let's just hope she doesn't break it or lose it. </p>
<p>She was so surprised at how clear everything looked when she first put it on. And all the colors were brighter. She is supposed to wear it all the time even though she is nearsighted. It is supposed to help prevent her eyes from progressing worst quicker.</p>

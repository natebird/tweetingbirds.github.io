<p>She keeps getting cuter everyday.</p>
<ul>
<li>Has gotten very clingy to mom. Wants me to hold her all the time.</li>
<li>She has her two bottom teeth. Got them at 4 1/2 months old. And she is still teething, drooling all the time.</li>
<li>She started to eat solids and haven't been that interested in solids. Definitely don't care for rice cereal or oatmeal cereal. She is better at eating veggie purees as is, nothing mixed with it. And she loves fruits. Doesn't care so much for peas. I totally understand.</li>
<li>She sleeps through the night now. Goes to bed at 7:30 p.m. and awakes at 6:30 a.m. Hurray!</li>
<li>She weighed 20 pounds at her 4 month check up. And when it took her in for her bronchitis we was 21 pounds at almost 5 1/2 months. Then at her 6 month check up she weighed 21 lbs 8 oz and 27 1/2 inches tall.</li>
<li>Loves to grab things and put it in her mouth. She will grab anything within arms length.</li>
<li>Can sit up by herself.</li>
<li>Can't quite roll over it. She can do it halfway when laying on her back.</li>
<li>Such a happy baby and loves to be around people.</li>
<li>Doesn't like to be in the carseat anymore. She'll fall asleep in the carseat if we are riding in the car or if Nate is swinging it. But believe me, the carseat is heavy with a 20+ pound baby in it.</li>
<li>Love to grab and eat her toes.</li>
<li>Naps three times a day. Still nurses 5 times a day.</li>
<li>Just a bundle of cuteness. I love to kiss her cheeks.</li>
<li>She is ticklish on her back, belly, toes and cheeks.</li>
<li>I love hearing her babble and laugh. It brings a smile to my face.</li>
</ul>

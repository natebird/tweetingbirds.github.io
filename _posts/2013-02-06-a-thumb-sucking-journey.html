<p>My babies never too pacifiers. And Kenzie and Lai Lai didn't suck on their thumbs. Laney did. She started when she was 3 months old. Right as she was learning and discovering her hands and arms. As soon as she could figure out how to get thumb to mouth, she went for it. I tried to get her to stop the day it started. She was persistent. I didn't think a 3-month-old could out wit me but she did. She has always been persistent and stubborn since birth. But look at how cute that thumb was in that little mouth.</p>
<p>Ever since she started talking, she has had a hard time with speech. I didn't realize it until she was 3 that it was caused by her thumb sucking. Never had a thumb sucker before, I never thought about it that way. It was the way she would position her tongue when she articulated certain letter sounds and slurred words together. From age 3 to 4, her speech had gotten a little better where we could understand more of what she was saying. I was always the best at understanding her because I spent the most time with her. And it was also at this age where sometime she wouldn't say things at all and just sign, even if she wasn't sucking on her thumb.</p>
<p>Well, a few days after the new year, I thought it was time to get her to stop sucking on her thumb. I always knew what a difficult task this was going to be. As mentioned, she is persistent, strong willed, sneaky and stubborn when it comes to what she wants. Jan. 8, I just told her we needed to start working on getting her to stop sucking on her thumb. I didn't have much of a strategy or plan as to how I was going to do it, I just did it. Then I found a book "Helping the Thumb-Sucking Child" and read that. I didn't agree with everything in the book, but it did give me some ideas, although most of the suggestions I was already doing before reading the book.</p>
<p>Surprisingly she took on to the idea pretty well. I just told her that we were going to start helping her to stop sucking on her thumb because it was bad for her teeth and mouth. It makes her teeth poke out and look like beaver teeth rather than princess teeth. I showed her pictures of what teeth looked liked of someone who sucked on their thumb and normal teeth. And then I thought I would put a princess bandaid on her thumb to help remind her to not suck on her thumb. And if she could go from morning to lunch with the bandaid still on, she could get a piece of candy. And the same from lunch to dinner. If she has an "accident" (that what she called them) then she couldn't get a piece of candy and had to wait longer.</p>
<p>She has been doing amazing. She is at that age where she understands and have some kind of self control. And since we started, she would only have accidents 2-3 times a day. I did tell her that she could suck on her thumb during quiet time and at bed time. But even just 5 days into it she wasn't sucking her thumb at night when sleeping and she fell asleep during nap without sucking. I told her though we will work on that later. Since it's a habit, it's hard to completely cut cold turkey, especially for a little child. So we work on days then quiet times and nights.</p>

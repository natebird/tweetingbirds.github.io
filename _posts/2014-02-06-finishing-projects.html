<p>
				I finished up a few more projects. Some were new projects I thought of and others were projects that had been on my craft list forever. Some of them that aren't pictured areâ€¦</p>
<ol>
<li>We put hooks up in the girls' bathroom for them to each hang their own towels.</li>
<li>I made my own baby wrap that I am going to try to use with the new baby. I did lots of research on baby wraps and figured it would be cheaper for me to try to make my own. So I purchased 6 yards of fabric from Fabric.com then I cut it in half to make two. Then sewed on tags in the center so I can know easily where's the center.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each girl got Nate a tie as his daddy gift from when they were born - pink if they were a girl and blue if they were a boy. He's got a collection of pink ties now. Actually, Kenzie and Laney gave the ties to Nate a little later. But Lai Lai and the new baby got their ties ahead of time. I've been wanting to put a tag on the back of the ties so he can remember which pink tie came from which girl. I embroidered and hand stitched the tags and sewed it to the back of his ties.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8180" alt="140109_00009" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140109_00009.jpg" width="600" height="450" /></p>
<p>I printed a bunch of Instagram photos from Prinstagram and they turned out really great. I have been wanting to put together a collage of some of our every day life images on the wall. We had a plain wall in our living room. I love it.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8182" alt="140110_00011" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140110_00011.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8183" alt="140110_00012" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140110_00012.jpg" width="600" height="600" /></p>
<p>I crocheted some bun covering for the girls' dance classes. And I glued rhinestones on them to make them look a little nicer. Maybe this will encourage me to put their hair up in a bun for class rather than just a ponytail. I also ordered more Whirl a Style to make buns faster and easier. Been working great!</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8184" alt="140117_00015" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140117_00015.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>I wanted to make some felt hair clips for the new baby and for the girls. We put up a ribbon board in their bathroom for all their nicer hair clips. I added to the board with these simple and fast felt bow hair clips.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8185" alt="140123_00016" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140123_00016.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>I had ordered candy bracelets for Kenzie's class for Valentine's Day. I was trying to think of a card to make with it for her to hand out in class on Valentine's Day. This was what I came up with. I wanted to get Valentine's Day stuff prepared and ready to go just in case I have the baby early. Then I don't have to worry about it with a baby around.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8186" alt="140123_00017" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140123_00017.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>Kenzie's 100th day of school came up unexpectedly and I didn't find out about it until the afternoon before. So I decided to make this heart attack shirt. It's something that Laney can wear next year in kindergarten too. It turned out pretty cute.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8187" alt="140131_00001-3" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140131_00001-3.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8189" alt="140131_00002" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140131_00002.jpg" width="400" height="600" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-8190" alt="140131_00003" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/140131_00003.jpg" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>And lastly, I did a makeover on our silhouette frames. I wanted something a little more simple but colorful. And I needed to update Laney's. I wanted to have each girls' silhouette of around age 4-5. That's when I made Kenzie's was when she was 4. I made one of Lai Lai now, but I'll replace it when she is 4 with an updated one. And I went ahead and made a spot for the new baby too. I'll put one in there of her when she gets older. When I purchased the frames a few years ago, I went ahead and bought 6 frames thinking we would have 4 kids. The extra frames had been sitting in a closet all these years. Now they are all up and I like it.</p>

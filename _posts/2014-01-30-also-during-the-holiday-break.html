				We had a lot of fun during the Christmas break. Luckily I was sick two weeks before break and just the beginning of break. The girls were sick at the beginning of break too. We got over it before it got close to Christmas. We were able to enjoy majority of our break at home and doing family stuff. Nate worked a lot so most of the time it was just me and the girls. But Nate did make an effort to do family stuff and spend some time with the girls.</p>
<p>First, our dryer went out so we had to pay to have a repair guy come look at it. Here's Nate taking two loads of laundry to the laundry mat to dry it before we got it fixed.</p>

<p>Here's me trying to make grocery lists of all the cooking I was doing during the holidays for parties and family events. We had Christmas party at our friends Steven's house. And I made finger foods for Grandma's house for Christmas.</p>

<p>We had a couple game nights after Christmas. One night I did a game night with my old YW girls. It's always a fun time to get together with them when they are all home.</p>

<p>After Christmas also went to Ikea to get a bookshelf to organize a bunch of the girls' games and puzzles they have everywhere. One of the challenges of after Christmas is to find a place for all the new stuff they got.</p>

<p>Nate also took the older girls out to watch Frozen one day. Laney and Kenzie absolutely loved it. We got the soundtrack for it afterwards and have been listening to it over and over again every day. One morning after breakfast we went to a doughnut shop and picked up a dozen yummy doughnuts. Yeah, I couldn't let myself to give them doughnuts for breakfast. So we ate oatmeal for breakfast then had the doughnuts afterwards. Another day we went out for cupcakes. I've been trying to find little things for us to do together without spending too much money.</p>

<p>Then Nate got sick the Friday before the end of break and was sick the rest of the weekend into the beginning of the following week with a stomach virus. And then school was canceled the Monday and Tuesday of when it was supposed start due to weather. We had weather in the single digits! I was glad to have a couple more days to just hang at home with the girls and have a more time to just relax. We did get a little snow flurries on that Monday and the girls were excited to see that but sad it didn't accumulate. They associate cold weather with snow.</p>
<p>Nate and I also stayed up watching several football bowl games. There were some great games even though none of our teams we cheer for won. Maybe better luck next year BYU and GT.		</p>

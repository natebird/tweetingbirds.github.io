<p>We are in the perfect weather. It's that time of the year when it's around 80- 70 during the day and 50 degrees at night. Perfect. I would love it if it was like this all the time. I am not looking forward to winter. We've been outside more lately and spending time at state parks.</p>

<p>Laney runs more like a gallop and it's cute.</p>

<p>A mosquito landed on me and that was what happened. It wasn't even on my arm for more than 2 seconds. I'm allergic to mosquito bites.</p>

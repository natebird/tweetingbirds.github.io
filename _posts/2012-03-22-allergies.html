				This conversation just happened a few minutes ago.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, what happens to someone if they eat what they are allergic to? Like if someone is allergic to bananas and they ate a banana?</p>
<p>Tiffany: Well, sometimes they can get a rash. Or their face might get red. Or they might have a hard time breathingâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: Oh, man! I'm never going to eat a cat! I'm glad that the things that I am allergic to are things we don't eat!</p>
<p>She's allergic to cats, some dogs and pollen. Mostly airborne allergies.		</p>

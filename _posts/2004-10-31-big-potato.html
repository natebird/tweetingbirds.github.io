				<a href="assets/DSCF0547.jpg"><img style="margin:2px" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSCF0547.jpg" border="0" /></a><br />This is when we first got our LoveSac. It's not all fluffed up at this point. We call it our "big potato." Thanks to Nate's aunts and uncles for getting it for us as our wedding gift! We haven't sat on our couch since we got it.		</p>

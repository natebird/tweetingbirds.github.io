Yes, the whole college basketball March Madness. This is, and college football seasons are the only time I watch sports on TV. During the football season, Kenzie knows the TV is on some college game every Saturdayâ€¦ mainly keeping track of UGA and BYU.</p>
<p>And in March, we watch the basketball tournaments. I don't watch the basketball games throughout the season, only during tournament time. So how do I fill our my brackets? Pure randomness. That's why Nate hates it when my bracket does better than his because he actually spends time to strategize, analyze, and study the teams on his bracket. I just like watching the tournament games because you get the best of the best playing against each other. I cheer for the underdogs even if it goes against my brackets.</p>
<p>This is the reason why I haven't posted in a while and I probably won't post much until the games are over. I have to keep up with my brackets and watch the games. In my Real Simple magazine, it said employers lose about $1.2 million in productivity during March Madness as people fill out their brackets and keep tract of their standings. Therefore, I am blessed to have a job where I have access to a TV, one of the benefits of being a stay-at-home mom. I get to watch the men's basketball on TV all day long. Kenzie wasn't quite sure what was happening with the basketball games until I pulled out our basketball. And now she plays along, bouncing or kicking it.</p>
<p>This year, there has been some awesome games and upset thus far. I call Nate at work every few hours to tell him how awesome or close a game is and how he is missing all the good games. I also trash talk about how my bracket is doing better than his. OK, I must get back to the games now. I thought I would just write this little post to explain why I am M.I.A. during this time.		</p>

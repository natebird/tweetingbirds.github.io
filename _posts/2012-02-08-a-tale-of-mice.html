<p>It was horrible. Before Christmas I found a package of Nutter Butter snacks chewed up in the pantry. It could only be one thing. Mouse. I freaked and isolated myself and the girls from downstairs. It was disgusting. I do not like mice or rats. They scare me. After picking up Kenzie from school the day of the discovery, we went to Home Depot and bought traps.</p>
<p>I've been through this one before with Nate when we had a mouse in the garage. Nate is insanely humane about pests. I would prefer to have them killed so they never come back in again. But no. Nate wants a humane trap so he can set them free. So since he is our pest control guy, we got humane traps.</p>
<p>That first night, we cleaned out the pantry. Threw away any food the mouse had chewed on then put everything back in. We also went through the rest of the kitchen to see if he had been in anything else. Cleaned and sanitized everything. Set the trap and the mouse wasn't in there the next morning. So the second night, we cleaned out the entire pantry again and left nothing in there except the trap. We caught the mouse the second morning. But he didn't go without a fight. He had gone through a few drawers in the kitchen and walked around the counter leavening poop wherever he went. It was quite a bit of poop. Nate took the guy out then we cleaned everything <em>again</em>.</p>
<p>Well, unfortunately that wasn't the end of it. The third morning we found mouse poop in the drawers again and in the pantry. We had left the trap in there but the mouse didn't go in. Yikes! So there were two mice in the house this whole time!!! Um yeah. I was about to check into a hotel. I was trying to convince Nate we had to move. This house has been contaminated. So once again, we cleaned out the entire pantry and moved all the food back upstairs to the laundry room. Cleaned out the drawers and everything in it.</p>
<p>Luckily we caught the mouse the following morning. Nate took that mouse out we cleaned everything for the fifth time. Sanitized top to bottom. And by this point, I called in the professionals. I wanted them to check to make sure there wasn't any other mice in the house and that they didn't birth a bunch of baby mice and find how they were getting in the house.</p>
<p>The professionals came and told us how the mice were getting in and how to fix it. Nate stuffed a bunch of steel wool in the holes around the house. So we were good. Nope. Next I was going to crochet something when I got the yarn out of my craft closet and discovered the yarn had been chewed on and shredded. But no mouse poop in the bin. Although, later we did find poop on the floor of the craft closet. Oh how disgusting was that?! And I had to toss away an entire bin of yarn, even the ones that weren't shredded because I tossed away anything that mice had touch or even breathed on. So gross!</p>
<p>And after that, we found poop on the floor of the pantry again. After we had cleaned it out and after Nate plugged all the holes in the house. Great. We put out the traps again. This time in the craft closet and pantry.</p>
<p>We left for our little vacation to Gatlinburg (that post coming soon). The evening when we got home from vacation, we checked the usual places and no poop. However, Nate found poop at the top of the stairs just outside of the laundry room. That was where we kept the food that were in the pantry. So Nate inspected all of upstairs. Nothing. He went through everything in the laundry room and sanitized it. Nothing. The mouse ate nothing. Just pooped a little bit. Of course I went out that night and came home with 3 more traps. We placed traps everywhere in the house. And I called the pest control guy to come out again Tuesday after New Years (they were closed over the weekend and on Monday for New Years). He came and pretty much found nothing. He said the mouse probably was trapped inside from when Nate placed steel wool all around the house. But the mouse found a way out and never came back in. OK. That was that. We kept the trap out just in case. And we sanitized everything top to bottom.</p>
<p>The end, right? Nope. About a week or so later I came downstairs to get breakfast ready for the girls so we can head off to school. That's when I saw mouse poop AGAIN! On the kitchen counter. Right in front of the wall plug that made high frequency noises that was supposed to keep mice and other rodents away. Yeah. That stuff didn't work at all. And the mouse pooped right in front of it just to mock us. And there was poop on the floor of the pantry. I stayed away until Nate got home and checked it out. I called pest control again but requested another technician this time. He came out and checked our house later that afternoon. He found a hole outside of the house where the mouse came in. As soon as Nate came home I had him plugged that hole then sanitized the kitchen again for the gazillion time. Our house is pretty much made of steel wool now. Whatever it takes to keep them out. That should be the last of it. That was 3 weeks ago and I haven't seen any poop since then.</p>
<p>My next house, it's going to be rodent and mice proof before I will move in. We will cover the entire house with steel wool.</p>
<p>Oh, and we have been living like this the past few months. Not fun. Mouse traps everywhere and everything now in plastic containers. And the rest of the food in our laundry room.</p>

<p>This dress was bought from a thrift store by Merissa Haymore who used it in a YW activity. Then Camille Driscoll, the bishop's wife, dared her to wear the dress to church. If she did it, then Camille would wear it to church the following Sunday. So the both of them did. Then they started passing the dress around to other ladies in the ward. It became the traveling dress like the book Sisterhood of the Traveling Pants. It magically fit every type of body shape and size. It was fun on Sundays to see who was wearing the dress that day and how they dressed it up or accessorized it. I was like the ninth person to get it or something. And it fit my pregnant body. It had a weird lining in the top front of the dress. But other than that it was very comfortable like a mumu. It was made of polyester so it was light and airy. It would be fun to get all the ladies who wore the dress and get a picture of all of us. 		</p>

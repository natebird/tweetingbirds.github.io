				I've got to start doing these <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/category/flashback-fridays/">Flashback Fridays</a> again. I've realized there are still a ton of stuff that I haven't recorded from when Kenzie was born, growing up, and even from when Nate and I started dating and beginning of our married years. I guess I'll start from the beginning. Here's a post about <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/10/flashback-friday-meant-to-be/">all the things that happened before we even met that caused us to meet</a>. Some people call it fate or destiny. Whatever it is, we're glad it all happened that way. And here's a post about when <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/09/flashback-friday-the-first-meeting/">Nate and I met for the first time</a>. And since our anniversary is coming up next week, I'll continue from there…</p>
<p><a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/09/flashback-friday-the-hole/">Nate lived in the Tree Streets at BYU with my guy friends (Jeff, Braden and Grant)</a>. That's how we met. I used to park my car at a school at the bottom of Tree Streets. A few times, I would see Nate walking to school the same time. The first time, I said hi to Nate and he responded with, "Hey… you." He didn't remember my name. Ha! But we kept talking and I was trying to figure out a way to insert my name in the conversation so he wouldn't feel bad for forgetting my name. We talked about our families and so forth. He sounded like such a studious student going to school early to work on homework and such. I also remembered him carrying a newspaper. Little did I know it was just a phase… the studious part. I was going to work at the WILK at my SOAR job with the Multicultural Student Services.</p>
<p>At this same time, I was at the on and off again stage of a relationship with another guy whom I dated for 11 months, Ryan. And Nate was sadden by the fact that he was back home in Washington for the summer and during that time, his best friend, Taylor, met someone and was engaged when he came back to school for the fall. This was going to be their year to live in the same house and have fun.</p>
<p>Well, shortly after meeting Nate and the few times we walked to school together, my best friend Julia had a gathering. Her parents were out of town and she was having a gathering with friends at her parents house in Provo. Julia was married so she asked me to invite some people to the party. I asked the guys (Jeff, Braden and Grant) to come and they could invite their new roommates (Nate and Taylor) if they wanted. Taylor and Braden had other plans. But Nate came along. We played Xbox and Nintendo games. The guys (Jeff, Braden and Grant) kept telling Nate how I was the MarioKart champion. I spent an entire summer playing MarioKart with the boys I nannied in NYC, so I was pretty good. But Nate was pretty good too since he spent his entire freshman year playing MarioKart at DT (Desseret Towers dorms). Nate won most of the time but I did beat him in a few races that night. Enough to impress him.</p>
<p>The guys all showed up with the girls they were dating at the time, except Nate who wasn't dating anyone at the time. And I didn't bring Ryan because we were still together but on a break. We had a great time playing but afterwards some of us ended up going to my apartment for food. Nate didn't want to go off with the other couples. So he rode with me in my car to my apartment. We listened to Fuel in my car. After eating food at my place, everyone left except my friend Julia and her husband Josh. We ended up staying up talking until 2 a.m. Mostly about my relationship with Ryan at the time. Josh and Julia knew Ryan very well. In fact, they started dating because of Ryan and I. Josh was Ryan's roommate. I did mention in that conversation with Julia that I thought Nate was cute but I wasn't ready to start dating anyone until things were completely over with Ryan.		</p>

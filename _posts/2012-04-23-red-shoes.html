				This girl loves to wear my shoes. She is always in my closet getting shoes out and leaving them around the house. The louder the shoes when walking the better. You can hear her clonk around the house. Right now it's annoying finding my shoes scattered around the house all the time. But I know one day I will miss that.</p>

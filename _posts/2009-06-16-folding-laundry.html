<p>
				Saturday was laundry day for me. Kenzie loves helping out with laundry. After the clothes are dried, we take the baskets full of clean clothes to our bed to be folded. Last Saturday Kenzie was helping me fold laundry (she plays and jumps into the warm clothes as I fold them) and we had this conversation.</p>
<p>Kenzie: I'm helping you fold the laundry, mom.<br />Tiffany: Yes you are. Thanks.<br />Kenzie: I'm good at folding. Daddy taught me how to fold.<br />Tiffany: [thinking that it was odd she said Dad taught her how to fold since he never does the laundry.] Really?<br />Kenzie: I fold like this.</p>
<p>Then she proceeded to do this.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SjQRvV5TvzI/AAAAAAAAErw/ojT-ZynE3RU/s1600-h/fold.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 400px; height: 257px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/fold.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5346918162624659250" /></a>		</p>

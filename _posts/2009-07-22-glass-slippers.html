<p>Nate's mom gave these to Kenzie last year when they were too big for her dainty feet. They are still a bit large on her, but she wears them around calling them her Cinderella glass slippers. She even slept with them during nap time one day. I snapped a picture of her in the glass slippers after her nap with her shirt tucked in her skirt. She has been going to the potty all on her own without our help, so sometimes she doesn't get the clothes fully back on right.</p>

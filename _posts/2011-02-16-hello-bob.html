<p>I got my haircut. It was much needed. My hair was pretty bad before I went in. And I had a job in North Carolina where I was going to be filmed so I wanted to get it cut before then. More on that later. This time I decided to go for a bob so I can grow it out until the summer without the in between stage looking like a mullet. Yuck. I like the bob. Now I just have to learn how to fix it.</p>

				I know you feel abandoned and forgotten. That is not true. I think of you often. I have many pictures to catch up with, just in the process of converting it over to my new photo editing and organizing program, <a href="http://www.apple.com/aperture/">Aperture 3</a>. It is a pretty arduous task when I have over 22,000 pictures. And that's after deleting a bunch.</p>
<p>We also had Nate's parents over for a week, the week of Nate's spring break. We had such a wonderful time with them. So I didn't get much computer time while they were here. And I have pictures from that too.</p>
<p>And I am in the process of spring cleaning my house. Mainly decluttering. Rearranging furniture. Reorganizing all the closets. Then we also gave our yard a makeover. Planting new bushes and flowers. Transplanting bushes and flowers. And putting in edging.</p>
<p>There has also been a lot of family events with my family. I am also planning birthday parties for Nathan's big 30 coming up soon. We also just found out he will be walking on May 8 even though he won't be done with classes until beginning of August.</p>
<p>Mostly we've been going outside more since the weather has been beautiful. How are you doing? What have you been up to?</p>

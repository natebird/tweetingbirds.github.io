				Yesterday Kenzie kept pointing to my eye brows while saying mei mao. I wasn't quite understanding what she was saying but it sounded a little like marshmallow, one of her newest words, or meow meow, like a cat. She would point to my eye brows and say mei mao over and over again. She is able to identify facial features (eyes, mouth, nose, chin, cheeks, hair, and ears) but I haven't taught her eye brows yet because it has two words. About 15 minutes later I finally realized she was saying eye brows, just in Mandarin! She learned it from my mom, who often speaks to her in Mandarin, including facial features. Eye brows was something my mom would point at and say it in Mandarin... and Kenzie remembered! I guess now, she is officially bilingual (maybe not technically since she only knows one word).		</p>

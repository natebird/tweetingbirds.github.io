				It was that time of year when I got a hair cut. It's probably bad but I only get my hair cut once a year, maybe twice at the most. I actually have been growing my hair out wanting it long. So I just did a trim, got rid of about 3-4 inches but kept it below my shoulders. Had her thin it out a lot because my hair is heavy, extremely heavy when it's long. And gave me some side sweep bangs for fun. It feels so much lighter now! Yay!</p>

				I am still here. Just been busy. That's all. Mostly getting my first grader to school and adjusting to a school schedule again. Life is busy with 3 girls all over the place. And August is a crazy busy month for us. School the first week, Kenzie's birthday the second week, Nate's brother and family are coming to visit us the third week, my brother will be home visiting also on the third week, Lai Lai's turning 1 on the fourth week and the month is over. I hope to be back here soon to update you with lots of pictures! If I'm not back here in a few days feel free to call or text me to nag me to update. I need that nudge. Hehehe.</p>

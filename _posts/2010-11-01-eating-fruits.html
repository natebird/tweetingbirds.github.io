				Laney love to eat fruit. She will take them out of the bottom draw in the refrigerator and eats away. She prefers the fruit to be whole, not cut. And the fruit looks like this after she has been at it for a whileâ€¦</p>

<p>October 18, Laney selected a pear out of the fridge and she went off eating it. About 15 minutes later, this was what I found left of it. She ate the core and all. Or she hid the rest of it somewhere in the house and I still haven't been able to find it. Either scenario is pretty probable with Laney.</p>

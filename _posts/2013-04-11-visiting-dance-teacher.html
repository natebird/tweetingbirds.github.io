<p>Kenzie and Laney's dance teacher was pregnant with her long awaited first baby. We've gotten to know her and her husband since Kenzie started taking dance with her three years ago. And last summer Nate took guitar lessons from Ms. Neta's husband, Erwin. Well, Neta ended up giving birth to their baby at 25 weeks gestation. The baby has been in the hospital in NICU since then. He still has quite a bit of growing left before he can leave the hospital. I gathered a few other dance moms and we all put together a little gift basket for Neta and Erwin. We mostly contributed gas cards or money to help them with their twice a day travel to the hospital in Atlanta. </p>
<p>Laney, Lai Lai and I took the basket to their house one morning and got to visit with them for a while. Laney has been asking Ms. Neta to see her dogs for a long time. So this time Laney finally got to see her dogs. It was nice to talk to her and her experiences with having a premie. They are such amazing people. </p>

				I started a tradition last year where at Christmas time I take time out with each girl and take them shopping for their sisters. We just have the girls get gifts for each other. It's fun taking them to the store and helping them pick out something that their sisters would like. </p>
<p>I took Kenzie to the Scholastic Warehouse sale. She thought that place was so awesome since it was filled with books. I had volunteered so I had credit to use up. We got a bunch of books and she picked out books that her sisters would like - Barbie for Laney and Clifford for Lai Lai. We went out to eat at IHOP afterwards. I am not a fan of IHOP but Kenzie loves that place. Her favorite food is pancakes.</p>

<p>Then I took Laney to Five Below. She shops like Nate. We walk in, she finds what she wanted and walks out. They don't look around or shop around. She got Kenzie a disco ball which Kenzie had been wanting for a while now. And she got Lai Lai a set of wooden puzzles. The first set was Disney princesses but on Christmas day when we were putting the puzzle together, one set was missing two pieces and doubles of four pieces. So I took it back after Christmas to exchange it. They didn't have princess ones any more but they had Minnie Mouse set of the same thing. So I exchanged it for that since Lai Lai loves Minnie Mouse. Then we went out to eat at Chick-Fil-A where she even got a balloon. </p>

<p>And lastly I took Lai Lai shopping at Joann's and Michaels. She found a book of paper dolls for Laney at Joann's and a science kit for Kenzie at Michaels. She was very cute to shop with. We had fun walking around the store and looking at stuff. She like to touch everything. Afterwards she wanted to go eat at Chick-Fil-A where one of the employees gave her a cow doll. She loves that thing. </p>

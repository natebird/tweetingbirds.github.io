<p>
				I am grateful for so many blessings in my life.
<ul>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Nate and Kenzie:</span></span> They are the love of my life. Nate is such a hard working and supportive husband. He has a lot to put up with for a wife. I am grateful for his laid back personality that balances out my up tight, OCD, and stressed personality. He is the most amazing father to Kenzie. She loves her precious daddy times. And Kenzie set the standard pretty high for all our future children for being the greatest little toddler girl ever. There is nothing I can complain about this precious little angel. She is intelligent, happy, sweet, a quick learner, gracious, and patient.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">An easy pregnancy:</span></span> Laney has been a pretty easy pregnancy for me thus far. I am at 31 weeks with her and time has flown by that I'm not quite ready for her arrival in a couple months. I didn't get really sick. I haven't gained much weight. I do have gestational diabetes to take into consideration with this pregnancy, but even that has been easy to control.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Extended family:</span></span> I love living close to family. They provide support to our family in various ways. I love attending family gatherings. I have been blessed to be in such a great family. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">In-laws:</span></span> I am NOT one of those people who dread my in-laws and I am so glad! I absolutely love my in-laws and all the extended family on Nate's side. We do miss them since majority of them are in the West. We try to keep in close contact with Nate's family through blogs, emails, phone calls, and so forth. Nate was raised by the most remarkable parents and grew up with seven other fabulous siblings all engaged in good works.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Friends:</span></span> I am blessed to have incredible friends who help me through the tough and fun times. I think it is so important for moms to have good friends to relate to and vent about girly stuff.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">The economic stump:</span></span> I know this is something out of the ordinary. But I am grateful for this opportunity for us to learn to live frugally and stop purchasing things we can't afford. It has also taught me to prepare for a rainy day like what the prophets has been teaching us since the beginning of time. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">My calling:</span></span> I love my calling as the YW President. I also love my counselors and secretary and advisors who provide so much help to a difficult calling. I love the YW girls which I serve, I believe I have the best group of girls in our stake. They are all so willing, come from great families, have extremely supportive parents. I am grateful for the opportunity to serve the youth in our ward. Having such a time consuming calling also has helped with the pregnancy going by faster. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 51);">Christmas:</span></span> I am excited about the holiday coming up and for the opportunity to teach Kenzie the true meaning of Christmas. I am also grateful for a whole season to be thinking of Christ and serving others. </li>
</ul>

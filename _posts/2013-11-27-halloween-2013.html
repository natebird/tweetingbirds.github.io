<p>
				This Halloween the girls dressed up as Little Red Riding Hood (Kenzie), a fairy princess (Laney), and Minnie Mouse (Lai Lai). I had purchased the Little Red Riding Hood after Halloween last season. I just had to convince Kenzie to dress up as that. </p>
<p>Then I found the wedding dress at the thrift store for Laney. It is actually from David's Bridal for a flower girl. She put that on and immediately said, "Look! I'm a wedding girl!" She was so excited because she has been really interested in weddings lately. Nate wasn't too fond of the idea of her being a bride for Halloween. So I changed it to a fairy princess with wings and a flower crown that I made. </p>
<p>And then Lai Lai wouldn't be anything but Minnie Mouse this year. We found that costume at Costco for $10. She was so excited to be Minnie. She loves Minnie. </p>
<p>The girls had a great time trunk-or-treating at the ward party. And then we went around the neighborhood on Halloween. They collected a lot of candy that we kept a few then donated majority of it to Kenzie's teacher at school. We don't do a lot of candy over here, especially since we're not big chocolate people. It was a great and simple Halloween.  </p>

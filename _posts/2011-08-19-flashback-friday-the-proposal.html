				Poor Nate. The proposal didn't turn out at all what he had planned. Everything was working against him that day. First of all, these Mormon proposals aren't really much of a surprise when we had already talked about getting married and I knew he had ordered my ring. And once Nate got the ring, it was just burning a hole in his pocket.</p>
<p>It was a regular Saturday in January at BYU. Nate had to take an economics exam that morning at the testing center so he was gone for about 5-6 hours with that test. While he was gone, I thought I would do some studying myself. I gathered my stuff and headed up to Sundance, one of my favorite places to study. Unfortunately, when I got there, it was packed with people for the Sundance Film Festival. I had forgotten that it was going on that weekend. So I headed back down the mountain and settled for Borders at Riverwoods. I sat in the cafe and studied for a few hours.</p>
<p>Next I got a call from Nate wanting to know if I was at my apartment. He had just finished his econ exam and bombed it. He was in a really frustrated and bad mood. He had studied a long time for that test and it was horrible. I told him I was at Borders because Sundance was filled with people. We decided to meet up back at my apartment. Once we met up, I could tell Nate was in a bad mood. This test just ruined his entire weekend. And somewhere in the conversation, he said, "I just want to go for a drive or something." So I suggested we go for a drive. But Nate said something like he didn't know where to go. I convinced him that we could just drive around, didn't have to go anywhere in particular. We did just that. We were in his blue Toyota truck and we started to head up the mountain.</p>
<p>Nate was bummed that Sundance was packed because he had wanted to go up there with me. It's one of my favorite places. That was his original plan to propose up there. So changed of plans. We stopped at the Canyons Ski and Resorts because Nate loved to go snowboarding there and I had never been there before. The place was closed by the time we got up there and no one was around. We walked around the place peeking through the windows at some shops and such. It was <em>freezing</em> cold outside and I wasn't warm enough in my jacket. But Nate kept wanting to wander around aimlessly. Finally we went back to the truck.</p>
<p>It was dinner time so he thought of this nice restaurant he had been to before in Salt Lake City. So we drove the long way to SLC and by the time we drove by the restaurant, we saw there were people lined up outside. Both starving by this time around 7 or 8 p.m., we just settled for Chilli's. After dinner, he wanted to walk around Temple Square. By the time we got there, Temple Square was closed. Poor Nate. Nothing was going his way that day. We decided to head back to my apartment and rent a movie at Blockbuster.</p>
<p>The Blockbuster was on the way to my apartment. But when we got to the turn, Nate went the other way. I said something like he was going the wrong way. But he responded, "No, I'm not." So I knew then that he was going to propose and he was heading toward the Provo Temple. It was his last resort. I don't know why he didn't just scrap the whole thing and tried to make another attempt another day.</p>
<p>We went up to the Provo Temple and it was closed but we could walk around the temple grounds. It was dark outside except for the temple lights and a few street lights. And still freezing cold weather outside. Nate lead me to the front of the temple. Then we headed to the fountain, walked around it and kept going. We were just wandering around the temple grounds. The whole time I was thinking, "Is he going to do it here? Where are we going?" Then he asked me, "Have you been to the back of the temple?" I hadn't. So we walked back there and by a bench he knelt down and proposed. It was sweet but I felt bad for him that everything went so wrong from what he had planned. He didn't want to propose at the Provo Temple, but it was completely a last minute decision. And he was so excited to show me the ring but it was so dark outside I couldn't see it very well.</p>
<p>We ran back into the truck because I was frozen. And we went to Blockbuster on the way back to my apartment. I don't even remember what movie we had rented or if we even watched it because we ended up calling his family to tell them it was official. We couldn't call my family because it was way too late on the East coast. We told them the next day. We were so excited afterwards that we totally forgot to take pictures. And since we didn't know it was going to be a proposal day, we didn't take any pictures during the day. Oh well. All it mattered was that we were getting married.		</p>

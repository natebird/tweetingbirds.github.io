<p>This year the Elf on the Shelf came back to our house again. I guess we are a sight to see, as in our house is always a zoo. This year we got a girl elf and the girls named her Dott because she has polka dots on her skirt. She has been a good elf so far. Haven't done anything crazy yet. She just moves around the house from place to place. Although couple of random nights she forgot to move. She is not mischievous like some other elves I have heard about. I'm glad because I don't want to have to clean up after an elf too. The elf is supposed to watch the girls and report how they our girls did each night to Santa and come back the next morning in a different spot. Well, it hasn't helped our girls behave any better. They just get excited to come downstairs each morning to look for the elf.		</p>

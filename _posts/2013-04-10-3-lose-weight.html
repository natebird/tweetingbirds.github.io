<p>I did a good job dropping the first 15 pounds before going to Disney World last year. But I still had the last 5 pounds I wanted to drop before I turned 30. That last 5 pounds were stubborn. I stayed there for a good 6 months. So after the new year, I decided to get serious again about losing weight. Although I didn't gain any weight over the holidays, I could feel my clothes fitting differently. Not in a nice way. Then in March I got a stomach bug for a few days. That helped me drop 2 pounds. So I had three more to go. I got back into the gym but could only make it twice a week at the most because of all the stuff going on. We've been really busy lately. I after our Utah trip, I was two pounds away. Still two more weeks to go. I'll see if I can make it. </p>
<p>Nate also got me a <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0095PZHZE/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B0095PZHZE&linkCode=as2&tag=simmodmom-20">Fitbit Zip</a><img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/ir?t=simmodmom-20&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=B0095PZHZE" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" /> to keep track of how many calories I am burning and how many steps I am taking a day. It's pretty cool and I love it. Anyway, I was hoping I would drop the weight before we left for Utah/Idaho but I just can't seem to drop the last few pounds! That's okay though. My body hasn't been this active in a long time. And I can fit into a lot of my old clothes. I don't care to get back to my weight before I got married. I was so skinny back then. And it was before I had kids. After kids, my body is completely different but I am okay with that. Luckily I never wear a bikini! </p>

<p>So we are excited to announce that we will be having another child coming mid February. And it's a girl!</p>
<p>This pregnancy has been completely different than the last three. The last three were somewhat the same for the most part. But this one I have been having blackouts when I go from sitting to standing up. Sometimes it's fade to black and back pretty quickly. Other times it's a complete blackout where I can't see anything for several seconds. I have to catch myself, hold on to something, wait for to blackout to fade away then start walking again. I can still hear what's going around me, just can't see anything.</p>
<p>Also this time my hair is starting to fall out before the baby is born. Usually my hair falls out after baby. And fortunately I haven't been as sick with this one. For the most part I have been fine and it is the first pregnancy where I didn't throw up. There were moments where I felt nausea but not all day long, all the time, like with past pregnancies. I have had moments where I felt sick, especially when flying. And I have a strong sense of smell, but not as bad as previous times where it made me sick all the time. I've been having aversion to food - onions, garlic, garlic flavoring, beef, pork, any types of beans, any type of peas. But pretty much at 12 weeks all the sickness and nausea went away.</p>
<p>Weird things have also been happening to my skin during this pregnancy. I had eczema, my face broke out in a bad rash that lasted about a week, and such. I was sure this one was a boy since the pregnancy has been so different than the other 3 girls.</p>
<p>One thing that has been the same is I have been extremely tired all the time. I am having to take a nap if I can. And those who know me know that I don't take naps. But with this pregnancy, if I don't take a nap, I won't last the whole day. So on days when I can't get a nap in, I am beat by 2 p.m.</p>
<p>We found out pretty quickly about this pregnancy. As with all others, this one was planned and we are quite accurate. This one will be 2 1/2 years apart from Lai Lai. Every other child's birthday is three weeks after the older child. Nate and I kept this one a secret until we found out if the baby's gender. We didn't even tell the kids. We did end up telling Nate's parents a little earlier because we went out to Washington to visit for 10 days and being with Nate's parents they would know. Plus they needed to know my aversion to certain foods. But we made them keep it a secret too mainly because we wanted to know the gender before we told the kids.</p>
<p>The morning we went in to do the ultrasound, I told the girls that we are going to have another baby and we were all going to go find out together if it was a boy or girl. They were excited to have another addition to the family. They all wanted a brother. Lai Lai even said, "I don't like sisters. I want a brother." They were disappointed to find out that it was another girl. I was relieved. Nate was happy either way, or so he said. I think deep down inside he wished it was a boy but knew it was another girl even before the ultrasound. He was a little sad thinking of all the boy stuff he won't be able to do with a son after we found out. And now he's just scared that we are having four girls! Hahaha. He's going to need a job for each girl.</p>
<p>Now that I am past 20 weeks, I have a little more energy and my stomach is much bigger where I can barely fit into my regular pants. I'm dreading maternity clothes. At least this will be the last time I wear it!		</p>

<p>About a month ago, I got an email from a PR firm that was working on a job with Samsung. They wanted to hire pro bloggers to film video tutorials for a new Samsung product. They were interested in hiring me as one of the bloggers. At first I was a bit skeptical because I get offers quite often but for companies that I have never heard of or care to associate with. Or it could just be scammers. But this was actually legitimate. It was from a PR company that Nate had heard of when he was looking for jobs (they were hiring). And they were offering me an all expenses paid plus per diem trip to North Carolina for the shoot. And they would also pay me. This all worked out pretty quickly because the job was Feb. 15-16.</p>
<p>Since I was gone during the week, I had to work out how I could leave both girls. Luckily Nate's work is pretty flexible and he could work from home the day I was gone to be with the girls. Nate was the one to really encourage me to take the job. I was a bit nervous about it. Plus he was all up for it when he heard how much they were going to pay me for less than one day of work. Let's just say it was more than what Nate makes in one day. He kept mentioning that if I could book jobs like this just once a week he wouldn't have to work. He's so funny. I just love that he's such a supportive husband.</p>
<p>I had the agency schedule my flight for after Nate's work on Tuesday. That way Nate didn't have to take a day off work and I could take Kenzie to her ballet field trip earlier that same day. And I arrived back home 9:30 Wednesday evening. It was a quick one day trip, barely over 24 hours. But I had such a blast.</p>
<p>I can't say much about the product we were working on because it hasn't made public yet. It will come out this spring. But it was pretty cool. Nate was hoping I could bring one home with me. Sorry buddy. There were seven of us bloggers there (4 ladies and 3 guys) from all over the U.S. I had never heard of any of them before but we all got along so well and quickly became friends. The company flew us to Raleigh, N.C., picked us up from the airport and provided us with awesome swag bags. Each personalized for the person and each item had personalized notes. The employees of the PR firm were so awesome. Mine had fabric (because they knew I liked to sew and craft), gift cards, movies, Cheerwine (other people had beer, but in mine they had soda because I told them I didn't drink), a ton of snacks, a magazine, a thermos mug and other little knick-knacks.</p>

<p>They put us in a super nice and new <a href="http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/rdurn-renaissance-raleigh-hotel-at-north-hills/" target="_blank">Marriott Renaissance hotel</a> that was located in the middle of an upscale outdoor shopping center. Since we were there for a short amount of time I didn't have any time to go shopping, which was probably a good thing. The hotel was also pretty secured. You couldn't go up in elevator unless you had a room key to operate the elevator. It had free wireless (unlike Disney World). And the hot breakfast in the morning was pretty good. It was in the Club Lounge on the 10th floor (that was the one I was closest to but they had a Club Lounge on every other floor). And they served a buffet breakfast of sausage, bacon, a ton of pastries, fresh fruits, bagels, toasts, cereal, oatmeal, eggs (with cheese toppings), milk, juice, coffee and tea. I was trying not to eat too much so I could still fit in my clothes for the shoot. But yum! I just loved that I didn't have to cook once during this trip.</p>

<p>The coolest thing about the hotel was the TV they had inside the bathroom mirror. Brilliant. I showed that to Nate when I did Facetime with him on our iPhones Tuesday night to show him my hotel room. Now he wants one in our bathroom. Ha!</p>

<p>And you gotta love that all Marriott Hotels have a Book of Mormon in them. I've check every Marriott Hotel I have ever stayed and yup. Always there.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3009" title="IMG_4039 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4039.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Tuesday night, all of us bloggers arrived by 8 p.m. They had a meet and greet in the hotel restaurant where they had an open bar (I ordered water from the bar. Ha!) and hors d'oeuvres. I had caught a head cold the Sunday before this job so my voice was a little scratchy. I was on the recovery when I got there but I still didn't want to drink anything that would make it worst. And luckily I didn't look too sick for the shoot. My voice was still not 100 percent at the shoot, but oh well. It was fun to meet the other bloggers and some of the employees of the PR company. They were all fabulous people. So friendly and went out of their way to make sure we had everything we needed and wanted and that we were happy. Talk about being pampered!</p>
<p>I slept great in my hotel room Tuesday night. Nate on the other hand… He didn't sleep well because he also had a head cold (all of us in the house got it) and because he doesn't sleep well without me. I think it's cute. I had a great view of the shopping center and a little bit of city of Raleigh because I was up on the 9th floor (the hotel had 10 floors).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3010" title="IMG_4041 (1) *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4041-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>They did the shoot in two groups and I was in the later group. Awesome because I got to sleep in a bit. Then take my time with breakfast and repack my bags. I checked out before going to the recording studio. They had a car service come pick us up from the hotel and took us to the studio. And we all hung out at the recording studio the rest of the day. We could have taken the car service anywhere we wanted but we all just wanted to hang out and talk with each other.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3013" title="IMG_4056 (1) *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4056-1.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>We were to bring our own clothes, within certain restrictions because we were shooting in front of a green screen. And do our own light makeup. They wanted us to look like us, which I liked. Then they had a makeup and hair artist do some touch ups and made sure we looked good in front of a green screen. The recording studio wasn't the PR office. It was another recording studio where they did shoots and editing for some TLC shows.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3022" title="IMG_4058 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4058.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3011" title="IMG_0944 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0944.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="411" /></p>
<p>OK, so they gave us $50 per day for our per diem mainly to use on food. Like I would ever spend $100 on food while I was there Tuesday night and most of the day on Wednesday. Plus they fed us everywhere we went that we didn't need to spend the money. Seriously, there were so much food. At the studio they had 3 snack tables, a catered hot breakfast that was there until lunch. Then they had catered lunch with dessert. And after we were all done with our shoots, they brought out even more food… celebratory foods with mainly snacks and drinks (soda, beer and wine). I thought I was going to gain 20 pounds just looking at all the food. I tried to stay away from it until at least after my shoot. It's hard enough to suck in my stomach that I didn't need all this excess food to make me look even bigger.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3014 aligncenter" title="IMG_0939 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0939.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="550" /></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="size-full wp-image-3016 aligncenter" title="IMG_0940 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_09401.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="550" /></p>
<p>We had a lot of down time while we waited for each other to do their shoot. But we all just hung out and chatted. It also gave us all some time to go over our scripts and memorize our lines. We also had time to play with the product we were doing videos for. There were TV and movies. They had wireless at the studio, very important for us bloggers. And we ate.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3017" title="IMG_4142 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4142.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>

<p>I am so not good at memorizing lines. And they sent me the script the day before I left on the trip. Aaahh! Luckily it was a short video. They were very good about prepping us and telling us what to do. Mainly they were so patient with me and all my goof ups. They had another guy there doing interviews and filming a behind the scenes. I'm sure those will be interesting to watch. I hate watching myself in videos. I am so not good at being in front of the camera. And I don't do well speaking either. That's why I went with print journalism rather than broadcast like my college professors where trying to tell me to do.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3019" title="IMG_4060 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4060.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>The Samsung Tab that I'm holding in the photos is not the product we were doing videos for. Just in case you were wondering.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3020" title="IMG_4061 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4061.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3021" title="IMG_4090 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4090.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Well, after the shoot we just hung out and then the car service took us to the airport. I was on the same flight as another blogger so we were able to hang out since we had 3 hours of waiting. The Raleigh airport is super small and deserted. There was no lines for security and only one security line open! So different from the Atlanta airport. Nate came to pick me up and I was home in my own bed by 10 p.m. It was such a quick trip that now that it's over it seems like it was all a dream. In a way I wished I had more time there so I could check out Raleigh a bit. The place seemed pretty cool.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3025" title="IMG_4088 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4088.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Once they send me the videos I will post it on Simply Modern Mom. In our contract it said we could publish it a day before the product launches. P.S. the videos are going to be on YouTube and will be used in all the countries Samsung does business, there will be subtitles when used in other countries. I don't really want to see it. I'm my own worst critic.</p>

				Along with potty training Laney, she started to tear toilet paper, toss it in the toilet without wiping. And she would do that over and over again in the same sitting. While doing that, she would say, "Look mom! It's money and I'm putting it in the toilet!" She was so fascinated and having the time of her life throwing "money" in the toilet and flushing it down. Where does she come up with this stuff?		</p>

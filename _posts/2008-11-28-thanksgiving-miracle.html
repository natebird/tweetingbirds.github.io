The day began with the traditional Macy's Thanksgiving Parade. We only watched enough of it for Kenzie to see the Sesame Street Float and Dora the Explorer. Then we made our assigned food for the big family Thanksgiving dinner. Kenzie and Nate made some sugar cookies with sprinkles while I cooked the green beans.</p>
<p>Next, we packed the car and headed to my parents' house. We hung out there for a bit, they live halfway from our house to my auntie Lori's house where we were having Thanksgiving. And finally, we headed over to Lori's house for Thanksgiving. We did the usual of eating, chatting, and playing games. The usual family fun Thanksgiving.</p>
<p>Our Thanksgiving miracle came when Kenzie went the whole day without having a potty accident. Yay! I was a bit worried with the car rides that took about an hour to get to Lori's house. But she did so well all day! Another thing that helped with the whole potty training thing had been the DVD I borrowed from our local library, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Potty-Power-Boys-Girls/dp/B0002B55DO/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=dvd&amp;qid=1227890847&amp;sr=8-1">"Potty Power."</a> It's a movie directed towards children. It's pretty cheesy, but Kenzie loved it and it encouraged her to be a big girl and have potty power.</p>
<p>Hope everyone else had a great Thanksgiving!		</p>

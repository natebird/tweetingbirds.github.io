				I'm proud to say that I'm a first time voter this 2008 election. This is the first presidential election since I became a U.S. citizen in 2005. Nate, Kenzie, and I went during the lunch hour to nearby elementary to cast our ballots. It was a great feeling to do my part in making a difference in our country.		</p>

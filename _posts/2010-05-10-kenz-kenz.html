<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">This 3 1/2-year-old of mine is a hoot. I love her to pieces and she reminds me of myself when I was a little girl. Very much so. Her mannerism, personality and in the way she plays with her princesses. Kenzie is also a smart little cookie. She still memorizes everything. Pretty quickly.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">She still loves princesses. She plays with them so much that her princess figurines are breaking and falling apart. Cinderella's arm broke several times and we keep fixing it with super glue. This time, it's beyond repairs. Jasmine's hair has fallen off. BTW, she does not look good bald. And her foot broke too.&nbsp;</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Kenzie still has quiet time for 2 hours a day everyday. She doesn't always nap, but she stays in her room and read books. I can hear her recite books word for word through the baby monitor. But one day, she decided she was going to put on her princess lip gloss and kiss the wall. And since we still have the original paint (flat paint) on our walls, it doesn't come off. We'll have to paint her room next. When I asked her why she kissed the wall with lip gloss, she answered, "Because I like kissing!" Not exactly the answer Nate wanted to hear.</div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b4zgjQ0FI/AAAAAAAAF_Y/OA5ypZiOU-8/s1600/IMG_4461.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4461.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
<p>Kenzie is growing taller. And she is getting more and more independent. She plays well by herself and has quite the imagination when it comes to role playing with her princesses.</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b40yxGC_I/AAAAAAAAF_c/9N7PRiQRt5A/s1600/IMG_4474.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4474.jpg" width="266" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">She also likes to draw and write. She can now write her first name in all capital letters. I taught her how to spell her name with a cheer. Just like I taught her to memorize our address with a song. She draws the most impressive stick figures and faces. She is getting pretty good a drawing and writing.</div>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b419BiUsI/AAAAAAAAF_g/ZmAVu9p_m3Q/s1600/IMG_4484.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4484.jpg" width="266" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And since she knows the pronunciation of letters, I've been trying to teach her how to read words by sounding it out.</div>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b43cW_8LI/AAAAAAAAF_k/jCZfax03oJE/s1600/IMG_4508.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4508.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Her hair is long and she won't let me cut it. She likes it long like a princess. I don't mind. It's fun putting her hair up in a ponytail.&nbsp;</div>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b44rmapII/AAAAAAAAF_o/PDHOLJcwfHk/s1600/IMG_4513.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_4513.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">She is getting better at eating. She at least tries new things. And there are times when she is sitting at the dinner table for at least an hour because she takes so long to eat her food. Mostly food that she doesn't care to eat.&nbsp;</div>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b47l0ECII/AAAAAAAAF_s/bENHJrwOJWU/s1600/IMG_5012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="266" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5012.jpg" width="400" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">She is a great helper. She is always wanting to help me in whatever it is I am doing. She is also good at cleaning up and keeping her sister out of trouble. She tells on Laney all the time.</div>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b4-NrpyvI/AAAAAAAAF_w/2U7Oo40sY9o/s1600/IMG_5447.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5447.jpg" width="266" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">Kenzie also self dresses. She picks out her own clothes and puts them on herself. Every so often she gets her shirt on backwards. And quite often she is mix matched.</div>
<p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/S-b5A50bH0I/AAAAAAAAF_0/v0iCua6iCy4/s1600/IMG_5637.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="400" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5637.jpg" width="266" /></a></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">And in some pictures, she looks so grown up and mature. She really is a lovely girl.&nbsp;</div>

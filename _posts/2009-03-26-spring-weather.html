				We have been enjoying nice 70 degree weather the past few weeks. It looks like spring is here to stay! I love this perfect weather of sunshine, cool evenings, and breezy days. Although, it has been an adjustment with the sunlight sticking around longer. It is still bright at 7 p.m. and I realize that we haven't had dinner yet. Ooops.</p>
<p>We have been trying to get outside more with the nice weather. I need to get out more to walk and play with Kenzie. I need to slim down for summer shape.</p>
<p>Here's Kenzie playing with sidewalk chalk last week.</p>

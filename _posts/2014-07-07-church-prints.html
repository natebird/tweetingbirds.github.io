				I love the Church's publication of Proclamation to the Family and the Living Christ, but I didn't want to frame the prints that the Church put out because it's not that nice. But then I found these through one of my blog friends. And although these prints were super expensive, I looove them! They are letterpress and graphic designed by a guy name Peder who used to work for Struck (a branding and design firm in Utah that Nate has worked with before). The detail work and the letterpress on these prints are incredible! And I found the perfect frames for them at Michaels for only $10 each! And they have a mat and everything. It matched the prints perfectly and just the look I was going for. I am so excited about them and put them up on the wall as soon as I could. They looked awesome.</p>

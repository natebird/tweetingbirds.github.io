<p>
				I have been working on writing down my testimony and instances in my life when I really felt the spirit. I finished it recently and have it saved on my computer. I am so grateful for the events and happenings in my life that helped me realize that the gospel is true and that I have a Father in Heaven who loves me. 		</p>

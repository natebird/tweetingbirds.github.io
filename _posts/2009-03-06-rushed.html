				The planets have aligned and a miracle happened. Both girls are down for naps at the same time. I'm going to see how many posts I can get out before someone awakes.</p>
<p>These are just some random thoughts that I have been wanting to post about. With the shortage of time, it has been degraded to bullet points in one post.
<ul>
<li>I've been trying to take pictures of Laney so she doesn't notice when she is older that we have over 5,000 pictures of Kenzie and only 500 pictures of her. But with a old, clunky point and shoot camera, I feel like the pictures doesn't adequately capture the beauty of my girlies. I've been secretly coveting an SLR camera for months now. But until then, I'll just have to made due with the point and shoot.</li>
<li>The weather was cold and crazy last week and earlier this week. But now we are enjoying 70 degrees sunshine outside. I love warm weather and sunshine! We actually had our first winter snow last Sunday when we were blessing Laney. We didn't get enough for it to accumulate on the ground, even with the heavy snow coming down. Nate kept laughing at how people made such a big deal out of snow around here. </li>
<li>I have been busy with YW and it will stay busy until end of April. We had a fundraiser dinner last week. And now we are getting ready for Girls Camp. A stake Variety Show coming up where we are in charge of the refreshments next week. A youth temple trip this weekend. New Beginnings in two weeks. Getting in gear for the LDS Prom in May. Application of the new YW value, virtue. And all the regular meetings, mutual, and so forth. </li>
<li>At stake conference almost a month ago, six of nine wards in our stake had their boundaries realigned. Our ward, the biggest in the stake, lost about 160 people. Even with the lost, we are still the biggest ward in the stake. With the realignment, I lost about half of my active YW girls, including my two seniors. So sad! It has been an adjustment seeing less girls on Sundays and at mutual. I feel like we are always missing people. </li>
<li>I think three or four Wednesdays ago we had a huge storm go through our city. It was quite a scare since the tornado sirens went off and talk of circular winds going 50-60 mph was passing over us. I was home alone with the two kiddos. Nate was at school. On all the TV stations the only thing on was the weatherman warning people to watch for tornados. They even cut off Oprah. The weather stayed on for several hours along with the storm and tornado warning. Luckily, we were all OK and the storm passed a few miles north of us, hitting downtown but not our house. Nate was also able to get home OK since the storm had passed over his school, but it was over by the time he got out of class.</li>
<li>I look forward to the times when my kiddos are both asleep and I can savor just a few minutes of peace and quiet. Rather than taking a nap, I try to get some things done around the house while listening to music (NOT princess songs). I have a hard time taking naps. I feel like there are more productive things to do that sleeping during the day.</li>
<li>My mom finished up with her last internal radiation treatment this week. Yay! She will have some post-op and check ups with her doctors. And I guess in about 6 months they will check to see if she is still cancer free. It has been a grueling 7 months of fighting cancer for her. I'm so proud of her strength, endurance, and positive spirit during such a challenging trial. </li>
<li>Lastly, I am doing well recovering from delivery. It's has been a month and I am dropping the weight pretty quickly. I am down 25 pounds now. Only 5 more to go until I am back to pre-Laney weight and 15 until I am back to pre-Kenzie weight. I am still wearing maternity clothes, only because I haven't had time to get my regular clothes down from the attic yet. I am anxious to see if I fit into my pre-pregnancy pants. That's always the depressing part. </li>
</ul>
<p>Sorry I'm jumping everywhere. I am in such a hurry to get these thoughts out that I can't even think in chronological order.		</p>

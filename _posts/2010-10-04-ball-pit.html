<p>I revived the ball pit a few months ago. The girls love it. But I didn't want it downstairs in the living room and there wasn't room for it in the playroom. The only other place for it was under Laney's crib. The girls have their ball pit time before bedtimes and before nap times. It's so nice to be able to pull it in and out. A couple weeks ago, the girls got the idea to put ball pit ball into the crib. What a party! They also dump diapers out of the basket to use the basket for balls.</p>

<p>We hope to put the girls together into one room by the end of this year. So we'll be looking into bunk beds. And I want to makeover their room. We'll see how it goes.		</p>

				I am joined a Atlanta blogger group on Facebook a while ago. They have been doing meet ups and get togethers. I haven't been able to attend any of them until January. In fact, I volunteered Nate to speak on technical side of blogging and how to make their blogs better. The ladies all loved it and learned a lot from him. We went out to eat first then he talked to the ladies at a coffee shop in Woodstock. It was fun meeting other bloggers and networking. The kids tagged along and did great since we were there for three hours, even during nap times. </p>

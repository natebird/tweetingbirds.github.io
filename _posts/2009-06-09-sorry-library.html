Kenzie has been excited to draw the mermaid in the book. So before nap time last Wednesday, I got a piece of paper, pencil, and the book and placed it on Kenzie's bed for us to draw something together. I had Laney in one arm ready for nap. I decided to put Laney down in the crib first that ways I would have my hands free for drawing. Before leaving Kenzie's room, the thought came into mind that I probably shouldn't leave Kenzie with a book about drawing and a pencil. Especially since earlier when we were talking about drawing princesses out of that book, she asked why we needed pieces of paper. </p>
<p>"Don't draw in the library book," I said firmly to Kenzie. "I'm going to put Laney down in her crib and I'll be right back. DO NOT draw in the library book." </p>
<p>I was gone less than a minute. Came back to find Kenzie drawing with fierce speed in the library book on the mermaid page. Of course, I scolded her and reiterated that we don't draw in library books. She said, "But I was trying to draw princesses for us, Mom. I was trying to draw fast." And yup. Flipping through some of the other pages I found more doodles. A total of eight pages in the book. Luckily it was in pencil, minimal damage done.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> I drew in the library book. I drew on Ariel's sister, the mermaid.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> Yeah, we're not supposed to draw on library books, huh?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> I'm sorry library. I didn't mean to. It was an accident. </p>
<p>Trying to correct her grammar.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Ariel and meâ€¦<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> Ariel and I.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> No. <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> Yes, you're supposed to say Ariel and I.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> No, Ariel and Kenzie. We messed with Ariel's sister.</p>
<p>I think we finally got our point across.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Nate:</span> What did you do, Kenzie?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Draw in the library book.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Nate: </span>Are we supposed to draw in the library book?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Nope. We read it and return it.		</p>

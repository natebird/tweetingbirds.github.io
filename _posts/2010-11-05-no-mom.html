<p>Oct. 22, 2010. Laney has this thing of telling me to leave her alone when she is trying to do something <em>she</em> knows I don't want her to do. For exampleâ€¦ This morning she was pouring her milk in her cup into her cereal bowl. Then sticking her hands in the bowl to play with the milk. When I said, "Laney," as a warning, she responded with, "Mom, no no. [insert gibberish talk here]. Ssssshhhh." She was telling me to not tell her she wasn't supposed to do that. She just wanted to do it anyway.</p>
<p>And yesterday, when she was holding water in a cup and she knows she wasn't supposed to take it into the living room or playroom. As I came after her, she held out her hand and told me to go away in her gibberish toddler talk. What a girl.		</p>

				I have so many things to be grateful for in my life. I seriously am blessed. I can't name them all because you would stop reading after 10, so let me just name a few.</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Husband.</b> Yes, all of us who are married are grateful for their husbands. But I wholeheartedly believe I have the best one out there. He helps with whatever I ask of him, never a complaint or question about it. He helps out with the kids and take them when I have church assignments or meetings. He does the dishes, cleans bathrooms, vacuums, takes out the trash, the list goes on. He is my (and everyone else's) tech support. He makes me laugh. He encourages and supports all my crazy ideas.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>My girls</b><b>. </b>They are the funniest and cutest girls I know. I love being home with them. I just love them so much.</li>
<li><a href="http://mormon.org/"><b>The gospel</b></a><b>.</b> I can't imagine being without it in my life. I don't know where I would be (that one is for you, Nate).&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Our families. </b>I am lucky to have a large extended family who loves to do things together. I am luck to have the best in-laws. I love Nate's family just as much as my own.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Most amazing friends in the world.</b> We love our friends near and far. They are practically family to us. Some of our greatest memories.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>My church calling.</b> It's true. I love what I do being the Young Women president. I love being around them, learning from them and associating with them. I learn so much about the church and how if functions. I love the the church leaders I work with and I learn so much from them.</li>
<li><b>Cheese.</b> One of my favorite things in the world. It's delicious.</li>
<li><b>Sleep.</b> I love sleep. I am one who needs 9 hours of sleep to function properly. I am glad that my kids let me sleep at night. I am adamant about getting my kids to sleep so I can sleep.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>People who read my blogs.</b> Either blogs. I love your comments and feedbacks. It's nice to know that my college degree is being used.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Magazines.</b> I am a magazine fanatic. I think we are subscribed to about 10 different magazines in our household. I get it from my dad. He's big into magazines too.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Coupons.</b> We have seriously saved over $2,500 using coupons just in groceries this year.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>

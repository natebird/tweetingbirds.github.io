<p>All of my girls attach themselves to a blanket around 9 months. It's usually the one they are using in the crib around that time. So Kenzie's was a lightweight blanket because it was summer time. Laney's was a heavier blanket because it was winter. She actually switched favorite blankets. For a while she had two. Then she started favoring the second one more so than the first. So I put away the first favorite blanket. Now Lai Lai's turn. She is starting to like this blanket that her Grandma Bird gave her at birth. It's the one she is using in the crib now. And when I go get her from her nap or in the mornings, sometimes she is holding the blanket with her. But she doesn't fuss yet when I put the blanket back in the crib. She's not super attach to it yet. We'll see if she's like the other girls who can't sleep without their favorite blankie.		</p>

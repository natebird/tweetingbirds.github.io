<p>
				We didn't do anything Christmas Eve. We put the kids to bed at normal times and Nate and I were in bed before midnight. I fell asleep right after midnight. The next morning we started out 2014 with everyone in our bed. I love this little family of mine.</p>

<p>Nate was working on New Year Day. I was going to take the girls up to Amacalola Falls with my parents and Jeffrey. Jeffrey was leaving that evening to drive back to Idaho. We wanted to do something together as a family before he left. I packed lunches for me and the girls and were getting everyone in the car when Nate came downstairs and said he was going to go too. He said Lai Lai convinced him to come with us. We were getting shoes on and Lai Lai asked if dad was going to put on his shoes too. I said dad was working and he couldn't come with us. So after we got her shoes on, she went over to Nate and asked him if he was coming with us. He responded with he had to work. But she asked him, "Dad, will you go hiking with me?" with a cute face and he decided last minute to come with us. It was very cute.</p>

<p>It was a great day at Amacalola. The sun came a bit later, but the hike wasn't too bad so my mom could come along too. She had been weak and easily tired from her chemo treatments. And she started losing her hair in large chunks. It was a cold day but once the sun came out it got better. The girls went up the stairs to the top of the fall with Dudepa and Jeffrey. Nate took Lai Lai up because she wanted to go with her sisters. I stayed behind with my mom. Then we went up to the lodge where a lady was doing a demonstration with birds. We had our picnic then headed home. It was a fun outing with the family.</p>

				I love the feeling of a new year. I always feel refreshed, like I have been given a second chance to better myself, my life, and my situation. Even though I started out 2009 with a sinus infection, a pink eye, a deadly cough that causes contractions, and a lost voice (still trying to get over it all), I was inspired by my little princess today. Watching her do her thing everyday, I found there is so much to learn from a toddler. All the things I should be working on.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Willingness.</span></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"> </span>Anytime we ask her to do something, most of the time, her answer is OK! That includes going to bed at night, taking a bath, going down for a nap, cleaning up her mess, or running errands with mom. No complaints about it. This one will probably be the hardest for me to do.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Be polite.</span></span> She charms her way into your heart by saying phrases like, "Can you play with me, please?" or "Please come over here," or "Can I please have a cookie?" I am more willing to help her out or do things with her when she asks politely. I'm sure it's the same way with adults.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Say thank you.</span></span> I just love it when I do something for her, like make dinner, and she selflessly says, "Thank you for making dinner, mom." I think we can all use more thank you.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Be positive.</span></span> Even when she is having a hard day, like being sick, she still sees the brighter side of things, like taking her yummy medicine.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Show affection, say I love you.</span></span> Random acts of hugs and "I love you" from this little girl will make my day. Nate probably need more of it from the both of us, too.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Love the simple things in life.</span></span> She couldn't be happier than just to spend the day at home playing with mom and dad. It would be nice to have all the fancy toys, but she is fine with playing with second hand toys missing parts.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">A cheerful, happy attitude.</span></span> Every morning, she awakes to a cheerful attitude, ready to brighten our days. I'm not a morning person, so that's not the way I wake up every morning.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Learn.</span></span> So absorbent to everything around her. Loves to learn and read. There is so much to know.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Ask questions.</span></span> This one can get on my nerves sometime. She asks so many questions all the time. "What's his name?" "What are you doing?" "What is that?" "Are you happy?"</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Surround yourself with people you love.</span></span> She values time and attention from the people she loves, especially when her daddy plays with her. Lately, it has been mostly mommy time, but when Nate gets a few minutes here or there to spend with her, she is in heaven.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Remember.</span></span> She has an amazing memory for such a little girl. She remembers who gave her what gift, even from months and months ago. She remembers people's names, making them feel important. She has an personal inventory of all her toys in her mind (that's a little OCD from me).</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);">Count your blessings.</span></span> She knows she is a lucky princess with so many toys and books at home. We also try to remind her that she is very lucky because not all kids have toys and books at home. Or even a mommy and a daddy who love them dearly. I need to do the same.

<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 153, 153);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Stop eating when you're full.</span></span> There are times when she stops eating before she is full. But majority of the time, she knows when to say, "I'm finished." One thing I learned about health from my nutrition class and my gestational diabetes class is that the worst thing you can do is keep eating when you are full. That's something for me to work on, especially when it comes to desserts or yummy foods. </div>

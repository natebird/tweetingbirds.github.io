				Thanks to technology, we are able to keep in contact with Nate's family who are far away. Nate's family does a family video chat each Sunday. Yeah, we get all his family on there some times from all over the country. It gets a little crazy sometimes but so much fun. If you can make it great. If not, see you next week. The girls love to see Nate's family, especially when Nate's parents pull out the puppets. It's hilarious. And the second pictures are the twins half faces together.</p>

				Since Kenzie was in school during the day, Laney and Lai Lai have a lot of time to spend together. Laney loves her little sister and she is always concerned about Lai Lai. And when Lai Lai wakes up from a nap, Laney loves to go get her. That means she goes into her room and climbs into her crib with her.</p>

<p>Well a while ago, Laney showed Lai Lai how to grab the basket of diapers and toss it in the air and say, "It's rainy!" Then another time the diaper basket was empty when I had just filled it. Nothing on the floor. Then later when I looked closer, I saw diapers tucked between the crib and the wall to where it didn't fall to the floor. So it looked like it disappeared.</p>

<p>Another time I went into the room and saw Lai Lai with the basket of diapers. The diapers were in the crib and on the floor. What a girl!</p>

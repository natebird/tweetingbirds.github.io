<p>Someone lost her first tooth last Tuesday. It came out while she was brushing her teeth in the morning. We thought it had washed down the sink but later that night Nate found the tooth on the floor. There are two adult teeth growing behind her two bottom front teeth. So the dentist told us we have 2 weeks to get them out or else he would have to pull them. Since they are growing behind the baby teeth, it won't help push them out. So we got her to wiggle them to loosen them up even more.		</p>

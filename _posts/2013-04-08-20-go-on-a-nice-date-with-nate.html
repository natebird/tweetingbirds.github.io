				Nate took me out on a date to Atlantic Station where we ate at the California Pizza Kitchen for dinner then walked around the stores. It was nice to get out with Nate. We ate really yummy food. We used to go to CPK when we were first married for a nice dinner, if we were treating ourselves. We even both got sweaters for ourselves at Gap for $0.11 each! We had a coupon and the sweaters were on sale. I love this guy. He's so awesome! I am so lucky to be married to him. </p>

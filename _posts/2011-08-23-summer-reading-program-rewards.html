				The girls participated in the library's summer reading program. For their age, the parents could read them the books. And after reading 20 books, they were awarded with their names on the wall at the library and a free kids' meal at Chick-Fil-A. That's the girls' favorite place to eat. After running errands and shopping with both girls one day, I decided to use those coupons to get them free meals. What happy girls.</p>

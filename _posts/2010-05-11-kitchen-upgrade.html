				OK, so we've been using our college mixed match dishes and utensils until just recently. Nate had a set of blue dishes he bought from Wal-Mart when he was a freshmen in college. I had my set I purchased also at Wal-Mart when I started college. Shout out to Wal-Mart in Orem!</p>
<p>When we got married, we combined both sets. Then someone had given us this blue set with daisy flowers. Not our style, but the person thought it was cute because we had daisies as our wedding flower. We kept it because it was our only set of dishes that serves 8.</p>
<p>With our sixth anniversary coming up, I decided it was time we grow up and upgrade our dishes. We waited this long to do it because the dishes were still functional, just ugly. Come to find out, dishes are quite expensive. Another reason why we haven't replaced them.</p>
<p>It feels so good to have matching nice sets of dishes and utensils now. All the more reason why we need to have people over!</p>
<p><b>Before:</b> Our mixed matched sets of dishes. Blue ones were Nate's from college. White ones with blue stripes were mine from college. Daisy ones from our wedding.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>After:</b> White set of dinner plates, serving plates and bowls for 12. It was actually 2 sets that served 6 each set. I also found wine glasses at TJ Maxx for $7.50 for a set of 12. Awesome!</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>After:</b> A set of nice utensils for a set of 12. It got an awesome deal. It was a set of 100+ (included a hostess set for serving) for $80. But I found it on clearance at Bed Bath Beyond for $60 plus I had their 20% off coupon.&nbsp;</div>

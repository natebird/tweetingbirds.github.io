				During our Family Home Evening tonight, Kenzie grabbed the TV controller and pushed the on button. When the TV turned on, she looked around innocently, acting as if she didn't know who did it. She simultaneously tossed the controller on to her dad to make it look like he had the controller the whole time. What a girl! She just wanted to watch the LSU vs. Ohio State game tonight.		</p>

				We blessed Nora while we were in Washington. Both Nate and I thought it would be nice to do that out there with his family. All the other kids were blessed in Georgia. Only his parents were able to be there for some of the blessings. So it was nice to have Nate's family there for Nora's blessing. I packed her blessing dress that was also worn by the other three girls.</p>
<p>Nate's sister also had their baby, Asher, blessed that same day. We did the blessing at home on Sunday, March 30, after Randy passed away. Nate's grandparents and some of his aunts and uncles were also in attendance. Their neighbor, Greg White, was the bishopric member who came over presiding in the blessing.</p>
<p>Nate just had his brothers and Grandpa Roos in the prayer circle with him. And afterwards we took pictures. It was such an amazing experience. Nate performed a lot of blessings and priesthood ordinances on this trip. It was such a spiritual trip for us. And I love that last picture of Nora and her grandma who she was named after (middle name Kay). </p>

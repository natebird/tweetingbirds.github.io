				Nate is already concerned with the girls and what will happen when they turn teenagers. And they are not making it any easier on him. The other day driving home from picking Kenzie up from school, she was telling me about school.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Today is Naomi's birthday. We had cupcakes and it had a ring on it.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Wow, that's nice.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah, everyone got rings. Even the boys. That's silly though because boys don't wear rings.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Daddy wears a ring. It is his wedding ring. It's a ring I gave him when we got married.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah, Daddy wears a ring. I still can't decide who I am going to marry.</p>
<p>Tiffany: [laughing and wishing Nate was there to hear this conversation] Kenzie, you don't have to decide that for a long, long, long, long, long time.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah. Like when I turn 15?</p>
<p>Tiffany: [laughing even harder] No. Longer than that.		</p>

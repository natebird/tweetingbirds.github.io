				Yup, Nate is back at it again, heading into his last year of MBA. It's nice to get back on routine again with myself and the girls. I love having Nate around. He help out so much with the girls and things around the house. He did a lot for my SMM blog during his break. He also fixed everyone else's technical needs. But we do get off schedule when he is around all the time. We eat later. The kids go to bed later. Sometime they miss naps. I still take having Nate around more and be off our routines over having him back in school. Last year!		</p>

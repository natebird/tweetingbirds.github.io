				Because there's not enough stuff going on with our lives right now (Nate going back to school, baby #2 on the way, Kenzie turning 2, my brother getting home from his mission on Aug. 7, trying to find a second car), the Lord has His way of humbling us and giving us challenges to "strengthen" us.</p>
<p>Our bishop called the both of us into his office. He extended me a new callingâ€¦ YW President. Um, yeah, at first, I thought he made a mistake. First of all, our ward is about to split, so I was surprised he would change up the presidency now. Secondly, our current president has only been in there for less than two years, she was called the same time I was called as the secretary. And third, did he not hear us tell him that we're busy with all the stuff happening right now? But since Nate used to be the bishop's executive secretary, Nate said, "Nope, the bishop knew exactly what he was doing. He has been thinking about it for a few months now."</p>
<p>Later, I found out that the bishop had been doing some researching of his own finding out if we would still be in the same ward once the ward splits so I can stay as the YW President. The call was extended to me two weeks ago and I was sustained this last Sunday. I've had some time to adjust to this new duty. I'm over the shock period and now I'm into the overwhelming period of all the stuff I am in charge of now!</p>
<p>I know that the Lord will provide a way for us to grow and learn from this experience. He doesn't give us any task we can't accomplish. It will take a lot of hard work, prayers, and faith.</p>
<p>1 Nephi 3:7 "And it came to pass that I, Nephi, said unto my father: I will go and do the things which the Lord hath commanded, for I know that the Lord giveth no commandments unto the children of men, save he shall prepare a way for them that they may accomplish the thing which he commandeth them."		</p>

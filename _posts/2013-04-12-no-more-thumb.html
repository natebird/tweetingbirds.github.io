<p>Laney did amazing job kicking her habit of sucking on her thumb. I thought she was going to have a much harder time stopping it but she did great. It took about a month and she was done with it both day and night. She earned a few rewards along the way. We gave her a princess barbie when she went seven days, just during the day, without sucking on her thumb. Then she got Barbie and the Pink Shoes movie and the Peter Pan movie when she didn't suck on her thumb all day and all night. </p>
<p>For the day, I put a princess bandaid on her thumb. She had to keep it on all day. A few times throughout the day I would check on her and if she had her bandaid on I would give her a small candy. Then when we got that down. I gave her a few weeks to adjust to that. Then she told me she was ready to try night time. For night time I bought a pair adult size tube sock. Laney helped decorated it where we made it into a sock puppet. That was her sleep buddy who helped her not suck on her thumb at night. </p>
<p>She did amazing. I was completely surprised at how well she did. So proud of that girl. Then I had her speech evaluated by the school. One of the problems thumb sucking had for Laney was her speech. So I wanted to see if she needed speech therapy. I want to get her all situated before she starts kindergarten in another year. We wait until the end of this school year to find out if she qualifies for speech therapy next school year. </p>
<p>When she stopped sucking on her thumb, she started talking so much more and singing. She was much more vocal, which I loved being able to hear what's on her mind. 		</p>

				Noticed that I missed a few days of posts? It's not because I ran out of stuff to say. Oh, no, no, no. I have plenty posts to catch up on of my girlies. But it's because&nbsp;I have been swamped with projects and everything lately. Here's what I've been doing and still working on <b>this week</b>…
<ol>
<li style="text-align: left;">Organizing our iPhoto and creating a second iPhoto for random photos that doesn't fit with our family albums. Mostly work I have done for others such family photos, engagement photos, photo slideshows, and some of our old family photos.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Sewing boards for Kenzie.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Sewing projects… so many I can't name them all.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Setting up a photo studio in our room.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Finding and making photo props.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Making glass pendants for YW in Excellence gifts.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Took my mom to the airport on Tuesday. She's gone for seven weeks to her homeland, Taiwan. </li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Doctor appointment.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Laney is sick with a stomach bug. We'll just leave it at that. Still dealing with this one.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Running errands to… Publix, JoAnn, Michaels, Hobby Lobby, pharmacy, thrift stores, bank, school supply store, bookstore, church.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Getting things together and helping out with our ward's Super Saturday. It's actually going to be on a Friday night. I'm teaching a class and helping out with a couple others.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Did five large loads of laundry. Including all my fabrics. Now I'll need to iron and organize the fabric.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Planning mutual nights for all of October with my Laurels. Then giving them assignments. Not to mention YW in Excllence on the 15th of October. Thanks to YWs I get to be a party planner at least twice a year (New Beginnings and YW in Excellence).&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Contacting a newspaper about a freelance article. It didn't work out, but they did have other plans for me.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Pulling out our fall and winter clothes as the weather here hit in the 40's at night. Brr!</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Figured out that Laney doesn't fit in any of Kenzie's 9-month clothes. Trying to figure out what to do about that.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Cook, sew, organize, clean, and some baking.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Helping people with their projects, papers, resumes, etc.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Making a family directory for the extended family.</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Going to bed late and waking up early. No naps.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Posting and planning stuff for my <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/">SMM blog</a>.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Started to plan for Christmas gifts and birthday gifts for my parents.&nbsp;</li>
<li style="text-align: left;">Church meetings and more church meetings.</li>
</ol>
<div style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/simplymodernmom/3970039991/" title="drying fabric by Simply Modern Mom, on Flickr"><img alt="drying fabric" height="349" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/3970039991_8e3cb08b8d.jpg" width="500" /></a></div>
<div style="text-align: left;">This is not even my to-do list. I'm not even going to try to post that here. When I hear people say they are busy, I wonder if it's the same type of busy as me. Here are some things I'm neglecting this week…</div>
<div style="text-align: left;"></div>
<ol>
<li>Obviously, this blog.</li>
<li>The house. It's in a disaster mode.&nbsp;</li>
<li>My RSS reader… Where do I even start reading when it has over 140 unread post from one day of neglect?</li>
<li>TV. I've cut out pretty much all TV watching.&nbsp;</li>
<li>College football. It's so sad. Last weekend, I didn't even watch a game. I had to find out that Tim Tebow was injured from Nate… although I'm not exactly cheering for Florida.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Updating our budget. The bills are paid, not quite sure how because I haven't even seen our budget sheet in a month.&nbsp;</li>
</ol>
<div>I'm done complaining now. I was just trying to tell you why I'm not here this week. And probably won't be until sometime next week.&nbsp;</div>
<div></div>
<div>P.S. Nate is leaving me and the kids next week. He's going to his sister's wedding. I miss him already.</div>

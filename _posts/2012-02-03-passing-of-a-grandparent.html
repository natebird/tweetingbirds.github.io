<p>My grandfather, my mom's father, passed away Jan. 21, 2012. He was 100 years old. He passed away around 4 a.m. He had been paralyzed for the past 20 years, first just one leg then the last 8 years or so in both legs. We knew this day would come since he was also bedridden for a few years. My grandma had been taking care of him for the past 20 years since his car accident that left him paralyzed. He is more comfortable now. But it was still sad news to receive. In a way since he lived so long, we thought he would outlive all of us.</p>
<p>That week prior to his death, one of the bishopric members called me on Wednesday night asking if I could give a talk that Sunday. He had someone cancel on him. I accepted the talk. He said he would email me the topic (general conference talks) to me that evening. He forgot. I texted him Friday morning asking for the topic of my talk and he sent it to me. So by this time I had Friday and Saturday to prepare. But we were busy those two days so I didn't have much time to prepare or even ponder the topic. Then early Saturday evening I found out from my parents that Agong had passed away. So that night I was an emotional wreck. I couldn't focus on my talk anymore. Nate was so nice that he did my talk for me the next morning at church. And he did a much better job than I would have done.</p>
<p>I like to think that I was Agong's favorite grandchild. I spent a lot of time with my grandparents in Taiwan because they would watch me when my mom worked. He would pick me up from school and we would walk home together. We watched Japanese sword fighting movies and shows together. My grandparents knew Japanese because when they were in school, Japan took over Taiwan and made that the official language taught in schools. And my grandparents traveled with an elder church group that rode a tour bus to various touristy locations in Taiwan. I would travel with them and I would be their entertainment during the bus ride sining songs into a microphone. And on nights that I spent with them, Agong would sing me Japanese songs. He wrote the lyrics to those songs in a little notebook that he would read every night and sing those songs before going to sleep. The last time I saw him was 3 years ago when we went back to Taiwan to visit family.</p>
<p>My mom was just in Taiwan for three months and got back mid-December. She flew out there again this Monday for another month. She is there for her father's funeral and to help her mom settled and adjusted to her new life as a widow. We are most concerned with my grandmother at this time. She has been taking care of Agong for so long that starting a new life alone would be hard on her. And she is 83 years old. My mom is going to try to bring her to America to visit for a few months. Hopefully that will work out.		</p>

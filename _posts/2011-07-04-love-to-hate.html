				Driving pass a school busâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, I hate school buses.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Why do you hate school buses?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Because they are too yellow.</p>
<p>Kenzie will be starting school in August. I don't think I will have her ride the school bus. Nate and I had a discussion about this and we both remember bad experiences from riding the school bus. That's pretty much where we were educated in the middle school and high school peer's perspective on life, drugs, sex and gossip. I didn't ride the school bus in elementary school. I walked to school. The school bus is convenient and would save us money. But I'm worried about the other kids, what Kenzie will learn and how she will be treated on the bus. It's one bus driver, who is supposed to be paying attention to the road versus numbers of little kids riding on the bus. But we'll see how that goes. Maybe I'll have to figure out a carpool system with some friends or something.		</p>

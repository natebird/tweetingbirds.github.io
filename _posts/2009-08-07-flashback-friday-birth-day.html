				Our Kenzie Wenzie turns 3 on Sunday. A flashback of her arrival, the condensed version.</p>
<p>My water broke at 9 a.m. Tuesday morning, August 8, 2006. Luckily Nate was working from home that day. I made the call to the doctor's office and the nurse asked me to come into their office to make sure my water broke, I wasn't sure myself at the time. At the doctor's, the nurse checked me and yup, the huge puddle of water I left in the room proved my water broke. I was also dilated to 4.5 cm at that time.</p>
<p>We checked into the hospital by 11 a.m. All the nurses were excited that I was so far along with my dilation all on my own. I wasn't feeling the contractions yet, but they all assured me that the baby would come in no time. I dilated to 8 cm naturally by 6 p.m. At that time, my contractions were 2-3 minutes apart and I could feel it pretty strong. But what hurt the most was Kenzie kicking my rib at every contraction. She was trying to kick her way out. It has been her personality since the beginning of time, just trying to help mom. By this time, I couldn't stand the pain of the contraction and Kenzie attempting to break my rib with her foot. I finally asked for the epidural. The nurse regretfully informed me that the anesthesiologist just went in for an emergency C-section, I would have to wait another 20-30 minutes before I could get relief.</p>
<p>By the end of that 20-30 minute wait, Nate was asking for an epidural for himself as I squeezed his arm to cope with the pain. Once on the epidural my contractions slowed. After a few hours of no improvement with my contractions, the nurses put me on pitocin to speed up my dilation. After 14 hours of labor, I was finally ready to push at 11 p.m.</p>
<p>The nurses and midwife, Julie, assured me that delivery would only take 30 minutes, an hour at the most. I pushed and pushed for an hour, couldn't get Kenzie's head to crown. I pushed and pushed for another hour, still no crowning. Dr. Sutherland came in and evaluated my condition and the baby's condition. The midwife asked Dr. Sutherland whether I should go in for a C-section since I have been pushing for 2 1/2 hours and still no baby. Having just came out of an emergency C-section and seeing the situation, Dr. Sutherland decided a C-section wasn't necessary. He gave me an episiotomy, used a vacuum and helped me delivered Kenzie.</p>
<p>Our Kenzie was born at 1:58 a.m., Wednesday morning, August 9th, after THREE arduous hours of pushing. It was a good thing I got the epidural or else I would have ended up with an emergency C-section. Our Kenzie was 9 lbs 2 oz and 19". She arrived three days before her due date. I'm glad I didn't go over my due date because she would have been a good 10 pounder.

				Tiffany: [with a grin] It's time for quiet time!<br />Laney heads upstairs.<br />Kenzie: But I don't want quiet time.<br />Tiffany: Laney is being obedient. Are you going to be obedient too, Kenzie?<br />Kenzie: Noâ€¦ Not today. I'll be obedient tomorrow.<br />Tiffany: You're not going to be obedient today? Only tomorrow?<br />Kenzie: Yes. Today I'm being whiny.		</p>

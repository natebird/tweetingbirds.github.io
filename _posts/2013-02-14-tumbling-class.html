<p>
				Last summer rather than having the girls continue with dance classes or dance camps, I signed them up for tumbling classes with the same dance studio. Although, this was their first time doing tumbling classes at the studio and, honestly, I wasn't that impressed with it. It was only a 6-week course in the summer, but there were too many kids in one class for one teacher. And they attempted several different things but neither one of my girls were able to perfect any thing at the end of the courses. They had fun though and it was something new. This coming summer though, I will sign them up for gymnastics at an actual gym. </p>
<p>And while the girls were in tumbling classes in the summer, Nate took guitar lessons. I had given him guitar lessons for Christmas the previous year. He has always wanted to learn how to play the guitar. He bought a guitar back in college before we met. He has tinkered around with it here and there but never really learned it. He got a 6-week lesson during the summer. He loved it. He wanted to continue with the lessons after summer but his schedule was too busy to fit lessons. Maybe another time. </p>

				In the summer we do a pen pal thing with some of our really good college friends who have kids around the same ages as our girls. We rotate who we send a package to once a month. This summer, we did a book exchange. And also along with the books, each child fill our an About Me form that tells their pen pal a little about themselves. Kenzie was reading aloud the About Me form from their friend Nick.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Laney, listen to this! Nick's favorite toy is Legos! Just like you.</p>
<p>Laney: Oooo! I might want to marry him!		</p>

				My dad had is birthday before Christmas. My mom was still in Taiwan on his birthday. So we had him come over for dinner and cake. I made him one of his favorite meals, roast with potatoes. And then the girls helped me make cupcakes for him. Of course it was decorated with pink frosting if the girls had anything to do with it. It was low key but nice.</p>

				If you have problems with potty talk, then this is not for you even though it's not graphic. </p>
<p>Tiffany: I need to go potty.<br />Kenzie: I have a bathroom you can use.<br />Tiffany: Oh, that's nice. Do I have to use the potty seat?<br />Kenzie: No, you don't have to use the potty seat. <br />Tiffany: [takes the potty seat off and putting it aside]<br />Kenzie: It goes on the hook, mom. [Puts her hand up to her ear] I'm listening for peeps, mom.</p>
<p>Her Grandma Bird will enjoy this.		</p>

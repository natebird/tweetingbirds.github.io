				We have been quite the travelers lately. Nate had some time off over Christmas break so we decided to take a little mini vacation to Gatlinburg. We had never been there before and it wasn't too far of a drive. We stayed in a hotel in Pigeon Forge because there wasn't any thing left in Gatlinburg in our price range. That was fine. Gatlinburg wasn't too far. It was a nice little getaway and see new things.</p>
<p>Laney and Kenzie both were sick during the trip. Laney was on the tail end of the sickness she got on Christmas Eve. She gave it to Kenzie. And even though we tried to keep Lai Lai away from those two girls, she still ended up getting sick starting on this trip. Oh well. We still had a great time. Scott and Stacey and Mia were also there on a little vacation so we got to meet up with them to do dinner one night.</p>
<p>We didn't have much planned to do while we were there. It was nice. We just showed up and drove around to decide what we wanted to do once we got there. It worked out great since the girls were sick. We did visit the national park at Gatlinburg and toured the visitor center. The girls really liked that. And the day we were leaving it snowed. So the girls got to play in the snow! Kenzie was super excited because she had wished to play in the snow this winter but we never got any snow in Georgia. And she also saw her first rainbow there while we were driving to the outlet malls. We also shopped at the outlet malls and swam at the hotel's indoor pool.</p>
<p>P.S. This was our first road trip in the minivan. It was so nice.</p>

<p>One of the things my kids miss the most about Washington… Lola. They still talk about Lola all the time. You say Washington, they say Lola. Lola is the last standing pet at the Bird residence. They once had two goats, two sheep, a dog and families of ducks roaming around their yard. Now it's just lonesome Lola. So boy was Lola excited to see my girls. And I'm sure the crackers and bread helped grow that bond between them.</p>

<p>Laney didn't want to give all the crackers to Lola. Saved some for herself. And she'll share them with you too.</p>

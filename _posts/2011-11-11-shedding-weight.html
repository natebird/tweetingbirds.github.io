				With each pregnancy I've gained less weight. Thank goodness. "People" kept telling me they gained more weight with each pregnancy. Well, I was at 45 pounds with Kenzie. So that was disheartening to think I would gain more than that with each pregnancy. Luckily I was the opposite.</p>
<p>My pregnancy with Kenzie I gained 45 pounds. After 6 months of her birth, I quickly dropped 35 pounds with nursing. I love that nursing helps me lose weight. My pregnancy with Laney I gained 35 pounds. Yay! And by 4-5 months after her birth I lost the 35 pounds with nursing. The 35 pounds went kind of quickly and that made me nervous. I didn't want to lose too much weight so I started to eat a little more. What was I thinking?! I had gained 5 pounds back by the time I was pregnant with Lai Lai.</p>
<p>My pregnancy with Lai LaiÂ I gained 32 pounds. And now, 2 1/2 month after her birth, I have lost 28 pounds. I am happy to say that by 8 weeks postpartum I put away all my maternity clothes. Not to say I look good in my regular clothes. I still have a flabby tummy and a muffin top when I wear my jeans. But I figured that would be motivation for me to shed the last few pounds.</p>
<p>My goal weight is actually what I was before I had any kids. And right now, I'm 19 pounds away from that. But all in all, it's not so much the weight that I am concerned about. It's how my clothes fit on me and I want to look toned. I want to get rid of the flabby tummy, butt, thighs and arms. Those are my trouble areas.</p>
<p>We eat pretty healthy in our house. I don't eat hardly any junk food. I think my problem with food is desserts/sugars (which is not much considering the average American but it's more than I would like) and portion sizes. And it wouldn't hurt if I ate more vegetables too.</p>
<p>My biggest problem is being physically active. I was never athletic. But I did dance. So that helped. Now I just don't feel like I have the time or the motivation to exercise. I'm an exercise wuss. I don't push myself and endure when I workout.</p>
<p>But Nate came home and told me his work is having a huge Christmas party in December. It's cocktail dress. So that's my motivation right now. I want to look good in a dress. We'll see how well that works.		</p>

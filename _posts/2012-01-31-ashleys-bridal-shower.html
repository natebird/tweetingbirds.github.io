				Also before Christmas, Dec. 21, Stacey, Samantha and I threw a bridal shower for Ashley. Ashley and her sister Samantha were my Young Women when I was the president. Love those girls. Then Ashley grew up and went to BYU and now she is engaged. Over the Christmas break, she was home with her fianc√©. So at the last minute, we decided to throw a shower for her. It's making me feel old that the girls I had in YW are not getting married. Yikes. I started taking pictures at the beginning of the party then I forgot as the party went on and more people came. And I didn't even get a picture with Ashley! Dang.</p>
<p>I made these red velvet cupcakes with cream cheese frosting. It was delicious. I had a few of those. It was a recipe shower where people were supposed to bring recipes for her to put in this really cute cookbook binder.</p>

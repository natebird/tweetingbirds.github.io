				Kenzie has always love to cook like her mommy. She watches me as I make dinner every night and often would love to participate as much as she can. I have her help me bake muffins and other simple meals here and there. She loves it. And ever since she got her set of pots and pans for Christmas, she put it to use by feeding everyone and everything -- people and babies in books or magazines, her parents, other family members, all her stuffed animals, her friends, her toys, and herself. You can often hear her say appropriate cooking words while playing -- rice, hot, water, bowl, spoon, cup, cookies, cold, crackers, and much more. Quite the imagination. She even makes eating and drinking sound effects when she is feeding people or things. We are going to have fun in the kitchen!</p>
<p>This morning she had her cup of dry Cheerio she carried around to eat. I thought she ate them all as she brought back an empty cup. Later this afternoon, I found the following scene:<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R78f3wScUVI/AAAAAAAABZY/c5JBxuV-y7Q/s1600-h/IMG_7396.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7396.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5169885939960140114" /></a></p>

				September 11 was last Sunday. Last Friday was Patriot Day at Kenzie's school where they had a program remembering and honoring those who died on 9/11. Here was her take on the programâ€¦</p>
<p>"Mrs. DeLuca said we had to be serious at the program."</p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, what did you do at the program?</p>
<p>Kenzie: We waved an American flag and celebrated being an American. And we watched a movie about two airplanes crashing into the train buildings. [She meant trade buildings but she thought it was train buildings.]</p>
<p>Tiffany: Yeah, that was very sad thing that happened.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yeah. Lots of people died. And the people driving the airplane weren't very nice. They didn't believe in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Tiffany: No. They probably didn't believe in Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>Kenzie: But if they repent then Heavenly Father will forgive them and won't remember it any more. But I remember everything.		</p>

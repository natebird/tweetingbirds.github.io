				On our way home from our New Year's weekend in Kentucky, we stopped in Nashville. It's not really on the way other than the fact that it's south of Kentucky. But it was only about an hour and half out of the way and I've been meaning to meet up with my friend Jenny for a while now. Jenny and I met last summer at Whipstitch (the fabric store). She is a blogger like me and she does amazing sewing and other craft ideas. Her blog is also very mommy oriented, like mine. So we clicked right away. And you can probably just tell by the pictures that she is super nice and fun lady.</p>

<p>We first met up at her house and our kids instantly became best friends. They were all playing so nicely together. It was very cute. Then we went out to eat at a delicious restaurant nearby called Calypsos. It was sooo good. I wished I had taken pictures of it.</p>

<p>After lunch, she took me to a fabric store called Textile Fabrics and it was fabric heaven for me. The place was awesome! They had designer fabrics galore. And they were having a 40% off all fabrics sale and 75% off remnant sale. I bought a piece of remnant and some ties that were super cute. I will definitely be planning a trip there again.</p>

<p>Even Laney loved the fabric store. She gave the fabric hugs and kisses. That's my girl.</p>

<p>We only had a couple hours to spend in Nashville since we were on our way home and needed to get home at a decent hour with Nate having to work the next day. I wished we could have spent more time in Nashville. It's a gorgeous town with lots of things to do.</p>

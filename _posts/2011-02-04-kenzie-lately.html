<ul>
<li>Likes the concept of healthy eating of vegetables but doesn't actually like to eat them. Same thing with riding a bike or swimming. She thinks she already knows how but when it comes to actually doing it, she doesn't care to learn.</li>
<li>Doesn't eat much. Picks at her food like a bird.</li>
<li>Has a hard time playing with Laney because she likes to play a certain way and order whereas Laney is the complete opposite.</li>
<li>Favors both mom and dad. She doesn't pick sides. Smart cookie.</li>
<li>Super emotional about everything. Cries when she doesn't get things her way or don't know what's going on.</li>
<li>Is learning to read some of her books.</li>
<li>Loves to write and draw. She write in all caps right now.</li>
<li>Knows a lot about dinosaurs because she loves to watch <em>Dinosaur Train</em> on PBS.</li>
<li>Still loves the color pink.</li>
<li>Is excited to sleep on the top bunk once we get their room set up.</li>
<li>Is good about sleeping anywhere.</li>
<li>Doesn't take a nap anymore. Only once in a long while when she's really tired will she nap.</li>
<li>Getting better with her coordination thanks to dance classes. She's a little more graceful with her body now.</li>
<li>Loves Primary.</li>
<li>Wants to be a princess and ballerina when she grows up.</li>
<li>Says she will only kiss boys when she gets married. That was Nate's doing.</li>
</ul>

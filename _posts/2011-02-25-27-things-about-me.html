<p>Sadly I will be turning 28 this year. To me, somehow 28 seems worst than 30. It just feels old. It definitely sounds old. Like there's no turning back and I'm on the downhill toward 30. But I guess I will be thinking otherwise when 30 shows up around the corner. Right now, I'm just freaking out about 28. Can you tell how serious this is considering my birthday is still months away? It is already worrying me about what I am doing with these last couple years of 20's. Ok, deep breath. I think I can get through this.</p>
<p>I decided to write down 27 things about me so I can remember what I'm like while still living in the 20's. I hope 10-20 years from now I won't look back and laugh, but most likely I will. So this is going to be a super long post. In no particular order…</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>I still don't like chocolate. </strong>I've never really liked chocolate. When I was a little kid, I would eat it because all the kids raved about how good it was. It got to the point where I was probably around 10 or so when I thought, "Why am I eating this stuff? I don't like it!" Then I went through a short phase while I was pregnant with Laney where I was craving candy bars and the only candy bars out there were chocolate. Nate would laugh at me because I would enjoy the taste of what's inside the candy bar but not the chocolate coverings. I even tried to scrape off some of the chocolate. That was one of my fears about pregnancy, that I would crave chocolate.</li>
<li><strong>Nate is my everything.</strong> He seriously is my best friend ever. We are so much alike. Then in ways we are different, we complement each other. It's so awesome how that worked out for us. We have had disagreements but we never had a yelling match in our soon-to-be 7 years of marriage. And we have always worked things out. We both understand each other so well and respect each other so much that we never purposefully put each other down or talk condescendingly to each other. And we work so well together. I tell him everything. He is the perfect husband and father.</li>
<li><strong>I'm not a country girl.</strong> I listen to every genre of music except country. I've tried listening to country and it gives me a headache. I listen to pop, alternative, R&amp;B, Indies, Hawaiian, classical, rap, classic rock, techno, reggae, pretty much anything except country. When I was in YW, a couple of my girls were talking about a Blink 182 concert and I was like, "Oh I love Blink!" They were surprised that I knew who Blink 182 were. I replied, "I was listening to Blink waaaay before you ever heard of them." I love songs with good beats and ones that puts me in a good mood, ones that put me in a dance mood are even better. I love going to music concerts although it has been a while since I've been to one. Actually, haven't been to one since kids came around.</li>
<li><strong>I want to learn how to play the piano.</strong> I have always wanted to learn to play and I totally admire people who play. Nate comes from a musical family, however, he didn't get the musical genes. But whenever we are at his parents' house, I'm always jealous of his siblings who are gracefully playing the piano. I love hearing it. I took lessons when I was little. Then I played flute in middle school so I can read top hand better than the bottom. I took a couple beginner piano classes at BYU but that's about it. I want to really learn how to play it one day. And now that we have a piano in our house I want to know how to use it.</li>
<li><strong>I love college ball.</strong> I love to watch college football and basketball. While I was going to BYU, I bought student passes where I went to all their football, basketball and volleyball games. I also went to a lot of hockey games, some lacrosse and rugby games. I like watching sports (with the exception of golf). Every football season I make a chart to keep track of the teams (BYU, Utah, Georgia Tech and UGA). Every March Madness I do my bracket. I usually don't keep up with the college teams during basketball season so my bracket is completely random but I do well every year and most importantly, my bracket beats Nate's every year for the last 8 years.</li>
<li><strong>I don't like drama.</strong> I can't stand it when adults act like they are in high school. I usually stay away from the type of people who like to create drama because they like to have something to gripe about. I don't like people who are "friends" to get info out of you so they can gossip. I out grew all that since graduating from high school. I hung out with the "popular" group in high school but quickly learned that none of that matters outside of high school. I actually feel sad for those who never got that memo and still thrive on putting others down to make themselves feel better. Or they need to have a ton of "friends" to make them feel needed, wanted, loved or popular. They need to know what's going on with everyone so they feel included.</li>
<li><strong>I have an eclectic style for design.</strong> I have always been classy and elegant in dress and decoration. But it's just this past year or so where I discovered my taste. I don't like any furniture sets where you buy the entire room in one huge package and everything is matchy-matchy. I like some antique, some vintage, some modern, pretty much a good mixture of everything. I am really into light and neutral colors. I am totally not into anything trendy. And living in the South, I am not into the trendy Southern styles - cottage, anything animal print, anything monogramed, children's clothes made with large ribbons, humongous bows and polka dots.</li>
<li><strong>I am not a high maintenance friend.</strong> If you haven't called or we haven't talked in a while, I don't automatically assume we're not friends anymore. In fact, most of my closest friends I don't talk to everyday, sometimes we don't talk for weeks and true, sometimes I go months before we talk. But that's because we are all busy and doing our own things. But when we do talk and get together, it's like no time has passed. I think that's true sign of a wonderful friendship. We love getting together with friends and try to get together with our good friends as much as possible, but that usually means more like once a month or for those living out of state, once a year.</li>
<li><strong>I can afford to lose about 15-20 pounds.</strong> I never did gain the freshmen 15, but I did start gaining weight after we were married and then with each kid. I don't want to be super skinny. I think that's gross. I just want to get back to my weight before I had kids and have my clothes fit better. I hate how my clothes fit on me right now. With Kenzie I gained 45 pounds and kept 10 from her. Then when I was pregnant with Laney, I gained 35 and lost 40 pounds quickly. In fact, I lost it so quick that I began to worry and thought I would keep dropping the weight when I didn't want to. So I started eating more and gained some of the weight back. Dang. Now I have to work hard to get rid of this excess weight. I'm not one for thinking I'm fat because I'm still within my BMI. I just want to look good wearing my clothes without worrying about flabs hanging. The hard thing is I have no motivation to exercise. We eat pretty good at home, it's the exercise part that's rough.</li>
<li><strong>I am a water person. </strong>To drink that is. I love to drink water. And in restaurants, I always order water with lemon. I don't like to drink soda. I will drink it on occasion (like special occasions). And I will drink juice on occasion (like maybe every couple of weeks). And milk… well, I'm on and off about milk. I guess depending on what I'm eating with it. And if I do drink milk, I like ice in it. I am a fan of soy milk though.</li>
<li><strong>I like to dance.</strong> I've always participated in some type of dance growing up. So I think that might be my trick to losing some weight. It's just hard not being in a class or dance group and have practices like I used to. In college my roommates and I would have dance parties in my room. And now at home the girls and I have dance parties in the living room. The music has changed to something more age appropriate for the kids but I hope they like to dance like me.</li>
<li><strong>I like my sleep each night.</strong> I am not a nap person. Never been unless it's completely necessary or if I'm sick. I am, however, the type of person who needs about 8-9 hours of sleep each night to be happy and fully functioning the next day. If I lack 8-9 hours of sleep after a few consecutive days, watch out. I'm quite moody.</li>
<li><strong>My clothes has changed too.</strong> Since I have the extra weight and have had two kids, my body has changed and will probably never be what it used to be. I am having to find a new style for me and my body type. Difficult to do since I don't have the same clothing budget as I used to. Now all the money I used to spend on my clothes has been hijacked by my growing children who happens to not fit in their clothes every 6 months and partially to paying the mortgage. Lame, huh. Oh, and I think anyone who is not in high school or first few years in college should learn to shop outside of Abercrombie, Hollister and Aeropostal.</li>
<li><strong>I d0n't really like to be in charge.</strong> Shocking, right? I seem like such a large and in charge person. But nope, I would rather let someone else be in charge and I just do what is asked. I guess you can say I don't like to have responsibilities over other people. This is where my calling as YW president really taught me to deal with this. I had a hard time at first making decisions for a group of people. I can make choices for myself and for my family, but I have it hard time when it's for other people.</li>
<li><strong>I don't care about how much money people have or don't have.</strong> And seeing how people spend their money isn't an indicator of how much money they have either. I will always shop with coupons and sales. I am a bargain hunter and will not purchase anything at retail price. It doesn't matter how much money Nate makes, we are both savers and there are certain things we don't care to spend lots of money on (i.e. car, house, furniture, etc.). I will always shop thrift stores. It's so much fun! We would rather spend our money traveling and going on family trips. And our friends… Well, we don't care how much money they make either. We treat everyone the same. Believe me. We've lived through poorer than poor.</li>
<li><strong>I don't like grocery shopping.</strong> Yuck. Even worst if I have the kids with me. So I try to do one big shopping trip once a month and refill on produce, bread and milk every couple of weeks. And yes. I'm one of those you get stuck behind who has a stack full of coupons.</li>
<li><strong>Laney is my cure for many of my OCD tendencies. </strong>Kenzie is a lot like me in personality. And Laney is exactly what we need in our lives. Laney shows me that there are different ways of doing things and it doesn't mean it's wrong. Laney has taught me to let a lot of things go. I'm glad children are born with their own personality.</li>
<li><strong>I learned to come to terms with myself as a mom. </strong>Compared to the rest of the world, I got married and had kids at a pretty young age (married at 21, barely, and had Kenzie when I was 23). I had a lot to learn being a mom. And just recently, I've come to terms with myself about how I am as a mom. I am at a point where I don't care what others think of me as a mom. I am doing the best I know for my kids. <em>I don't compare myself to other moms anymore.</em> It's actually quite liberating.</li>
<li><strong>I make time for myself and don't feel guilty about it.</strong> Most of the time. And I have Nate to thank for this. He is a strong believer that I need to have time to myself. And when I wanted to start professional blogging to do something outside of being a mommy, Nate has been my no. 1 cheerleader and supporter from the very beginning. Being a professional blogger takes a lot of time and resources. He has never once complained about any of it. Even when I'm stress myself out about it. He encourages me to go out with my friends or go shopping by myself or whatever. Isn't he the best husband ever?!</li>
<li><strong>I still don't have my ears pierced.</strong> And I don't think I ever will. Just not interested in having it pierced. It's just another thing to worry about and more accessories to waste money on.</li>
<li><strong>I love to write but I don't think I'm good at it. </strong>This is not me fishing for compliments. I love to write and have always been a writer. But I am not very good with grammar. And I'm not a clever or creative writer. I think part of it is because English is not technically my first language so there are lots of rules in the English language that don't make sense to me. But I write anyways because it challenges me and I love it.</li>
<li><strong>I didn't date much in high school, but I did date a lot in college.</strong> In high school there wasn't a lot of guys to date, definitely no guys in my ward to date. Then in college, it was the opposite at BYU. My college roommies and I used to have dating contests… How many different guys can we go on dates with in one week (I think my record was 5 different guys in 1 week). Or dating guys on BYU sports teams. Or see if we could all date guys with the same names at the same time. And so forth. It was pretty pointless but it was fun to go out on a lot of dates and meet a bunch of guys.</li>
<li><strong>Most of my friends are guys.</strong> When I was a little girl living in Taiwan, my best friend was a guy. We actually got to meet up again when we visited Taiwan two years ago. In elementary and middle school, my best friends were girls because guys had coodies. But in high school and college all my closest friends were guys. I always got along with guys better than girls… less drama. Now that I'm married, I still keep in touch with my guy friends, but now I'm really good friends with their wives too. That's awesome. It helps that Nate was roommates with my best guy friends in college (that's how we met) so we hang out with them when we can (they all live all over the U.S.).</li>
<li><strong>Coming from a large extended family has its pros and cons.</strong> My dad's side of the family all lives here in Georgia. We are all within 2 hours of each other. I love my family. They are the best and will do anything for each other. We get together all the time (at least once a month). No one ever fights and we don't have much family drama. We vacation together for a week at the beach in the summers. I grew up with my cousins being my best friends in high school. If you lived in this area for a while, then you know my family. My grandparents have been here since my dad was in high school almost 40 years ago. Cons: You kind of lose your own identity living in a place where everyone knows your family. That's why Nate and I didn't want to live in the same ward as my parents. We wanted to develop our own identities. And sometimes there are way too many family get togethers.</li>
<li><strong>I never thought I would be one of those Mormon girls who would get married young.</strong> I was especially adamant about NOT being one of those girls who only date for a super short amount of time and get engaged. But I totally did. Nate and I dated for 2 1/2 months before we were engaged. I turned 21 only 2 weeks before Nate and I were sealed in the temple. Oh well. It was for the best.</li>
<li><strong>I love old people.</strong> I have always loved elderlies. They are way too adorable. Nate is fearful that one day he'll come home and our house will be filled with old people I've "collected". I love listening to their stories and being around them. And they can be the funniest people in the world.</li>
<li><strong>I have a goal to have 4 kids by the time I turn 30.</strong> And be done by 30. So far I am on track with this goal because we are currently expecting our third child! Yup. Call us crazy but we're hoping for another girl. The baby is due at the end of August.</li>

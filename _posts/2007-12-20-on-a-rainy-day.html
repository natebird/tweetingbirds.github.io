				Yesterday afternoon we finally got some much needed rain. It's been cold and dreary here the past few days. I don't mind the rain, but my body is not made for the cold weather (meaning highs in the mid 50 degrees here). I was checking my email in our office upstairs when I heard Kenzie blabbering on and on to herself. I decided grab a sneak peek at what she was doing in the guest room (where I heard her talk). Here she was reading aloud to herself, snuggling up to her favorite blanket and sitting in her old car seat. What a cutie... just like her mom. I, too, enjoy snuggling up to a good book on a cold and rainy day.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R2rfy-tV1zI/AAAAAAAAA0g/lzxzTGvuPdk/s1600-h/IMG_6970.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6970.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5146171591143839538" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R2rfzOtV10I/AAAAAAAAA0o/51sb-u4Be9k/s1600-h/IMG_6973.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_6973.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5146171595438806850" /></a>		</p>

<p>
				This morning I went through Kenzie's toys to collect unused toys to put in a bin up in the attic. I do this every few months just because Kenzie's toy collection builds up fast and being the clean, no clutter freak I am, I have to declutter her selection of toys every so often. Plus, I just get tired of picking up all her toys. It is also a way for me to recycle her toys so she feels like the old toys are new toys in a few months. Less buying on my part.</p>
<p>Anyway, while putting away her toys, I pulled out her baby doll that my grandparents got her for her birthday last year. She hasn't played with it much because she was too young to know how to play with a doll. But now she is fully capable of understanding what to do with a doll... well, maybe not fully capable.</p>
<p>She walked around the house all day with the baby in her arms and saying, "Baby!" And here are pictures of a few other things she did with the baby this morning.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Warning: The following pictures may not be appropriate for children under the age of 2. It may scar them for life. If not for life, they would at least be afraid to be around Kenzie until they are old enough to run away. </span></span><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R5TMRi65_oI/AAAAAAAABI4/t_dijcb-MXM/s1600-h/IMG_7202.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7202.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5157972075049778818" /></a><br />Kenzie and her baby.</p>

I have no idea why she does that or where she got the idea.</p>

That's Kenzie teaching the baby how to use a cell phone! What a funny girl.</p>

<p>Kenzie also took the baby down her side head first, put the baby in her high chair with the legs sticking up, stuffed the baby in a shoebox, and dropped the baby a few times. She was great at rocking the baby in the rocking chair, playing with the baby, and reading books to the baby. I guess she still has a lot to learn about taking care of babies.		</p>

				Laney is my child who thinks outside of the box. Nate believes she has that entrepreneur in her. For example, the way she eats. The picture of the apples. That one was at G.G.'s house for Thanksgiving. Both Laney and her cousin, Addie, would run by this plate of fruit grab one, take a bite and put it back. They did that each time they ran past it.</p>

<p>Nate was so proud of himself. He came to my dance rehearsal on a Saturday to tell me that he had ordered my ring. I asked him if he went back to get one of the rings we had looked at together. He said, "nope". It was so cute. He was giddy about the whole thing. My main requests for my ring was I wanted an emerald cut diamond and I didn't want a solitaire that stuck out too much. Nate said he went shopping for a ring and didn't see anything that he liked. A sales associate at the jewelry store mentioned that Nate could design his own ring. So that's what he did. He picked out 3-4 rings that had features that he liked and then designed my ring using them as ideas. The girl helping Nate was so impressed with him and what he did to get my ring perfect.</p>
<p>It took a while for my ring to arrive because the jeweler had to make a custom mold for it. And since Nate thought he was Daddy Warbucks from all the money he made the previous summer working for his dad in Washington, he spared no expenses on my ring. But once Nate received it, he didn't wait long to propose. It was burning a hole in his pocket.</p>
<p>I was nervous about the ring. Nate was so proud of himself for designing my ring that I was afraid I wouldn't like it after all the trouble he went through. Nate knew nothing about jewelry design and I'm picky with the jewelry I wear. So I just prayed that I would love the ring. Once I saw the ring (when he proposed) I was in love with it. I absolutely love my ring and I get compliments on it all the time. To this day, he is still proud to say that my ring is one of a kind. No one has a ring like mine.</p>
<p>The funny thing is that I had bought Nate's wedding band before he had my ring. One time when we were out looking at rings for me, we glanced at the men's wedding bands and we saw one he liked. So he picked it out and I bought it. Easy as that.</p>

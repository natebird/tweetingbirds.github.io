				I put the girls in swim lessons this summer. Neither one of them knows how to swim. With Kenzie being 5, she needs to know how to swim. So I was recommend this lady name Ms. Autumn who has taught hundreds of students how to swim. She does it in her backyard. She has been teaching for 35 years. She does three day lessons (Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday) for one session. She said that give her a good two weeks and the kid will know how to swim decent.</p>
<p>Kenzie was in the beginners class. Laney was in the toddler class where she was in the pool with a parent. Nate did it with her since I had to watch Lai Lai on the side. The first week both girls did pretty well. Kenzie progressed slower than I had hoped. Her biggest thing that first week was overcoming her fears. She didn't want to put her head underwater or open her eyes underwater. And then she wasn't as coordinated where she could kick and move her arms at the same time. So we put her in for a second week where she got a little better at that. The biggest thing with Kenzie was that she loves to play in the water now. Whenever we go to the pool now she wants to practice swimming. And that's what she needs is to practice some more. She can move in the water now. But she still needs to learn how to come up for air and to just practice some more.</p>
<p>Laney, she just did one week of class. Since Nate did the class with her, he thought that he would be able to work with her on their own. But we haven't had much time and Laney is hesitant about it. She wasn't a big fan of swim class even though she was more of a natural at it than Kenzie. She doesn't like to be forced to do something. Also since Laney is only 3, I'll put her in swim lessons again next summer. And hopefully Kenzie will be swimming well enough to go into the advanced swim class next summer. She needs to be able to swim across the width of the pool to be in that class. I think she can do it if she knows how to come up for air. Right now she will come up but not take a good breathe and go back down to forget what she was doing before. Plus she has really skinny legs and arms. Ms. Autumn said that sometimes it takes time for kids to grow into their legs so they can swim better.</p>

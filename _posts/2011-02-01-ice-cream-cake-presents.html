<p>OK, it's totally true. The second child doesn't get as much attention as the first. And also January has been a crazy month here in the Bird household. So Laney's birthday was neglected a little bit. We had thought about taking the family to the movies but, um hello!, movies are super expensive these day. It was going to be about $30 for all of us to watch a matinée showing of Tangled. And it was showing during dinner time so we would have needed to go out to eat which costs a family of 4 $25 at the nearest fast food (gross) restaurant. So we scrapped that idea since it's a little out of the budget. We wouldn't have mind spending that amount of money for something more enriching than a movie and gross fast food.</p>

<p>We don't throw a birthday party for the child every year. We celebrate birthdays, but don't go all out on parties. So… At the last minute I came up with the idea to make Laney an ice cream sandwich cake and we would do a movie night at our house. My parents came over and did presents with Laney. She was more than happy to have that for her birthday. Glad she's young enough where she didn't care. She got <em>Despicable Me</em> for her birthday and a few other toys and that's the movie we watched. She was excited to open presents and have us sing happy birthday to her. She blew out the candles herself. It took a few tries but she eventually got both of them. Although, Kenzie did blow it out for her at first and we had to relight it for Laney to blow it out.</p>

<p>OK… So if you're one of those throw a party every year moms, you're reading this and totally thinking, "She's so lame! What a horrible mom for not doing something special for her child." Yeah. Well. It's probably true.</p>

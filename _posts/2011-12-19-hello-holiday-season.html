				Dear blog,</p>
<p>You've probably noticed I have been neglecting you lately. Just for a little bit. Although you are probably grateful for a little break from all of our happenings. I have quite a bit to catch up on as usual. There is not one dull moment in the Bird household. And that is the exact reason for my absence. This Christmas season has been insanely busy for me. And the worst part is I have been forgetting my camera!</p>
<p>Here's a quick run down of the next couple of weeks just so you can know what I'm up to. And just for record keeping sake. Plus I like to write down our day-to-day life so I can remember it when the kids are grown and gone. These are the main events, not my to do list. My to do list is incredibly long. Aaahhh! We have lots of things planned but all super fun. I just hope no one gets sick! So just these next two week…</p>
<p><strong>Monday:</strong> Visiting teaching all three girls on my list. Our annual gingerbread house contest.</p>
<p><strong>Tuesday:</strong> My day to catch up on stuff around the house and run errands.</p>
<p><strong>Wednesday:</strong> Stacey and I are throwing a bridal shower for Ashley. She used to be one of my Young Women girls. She has been out at BYU and just got engaged!</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> Get together with the Shohams. We go to their house each Christmas season to see the decorations at their house and sing Christmas carols while Mary Anna play on her grand piano. The girls absolutely love going over to their house. That night Nate and I will be having a wrapping party where we wrap all the gifts for Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> Lai Lai has her 4 month wellness check in the morning. Then in the afternoon we are getting our family pictures taken with my parents and brother. That's what we are getting my parents for Christmas this year… family pictures. It has been forever since we had one done with my parents. And that evening we are going to a Christmas party at our friend Sherry's house.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> Christmas Eve. We do Christmas Eve with my parents with a nice dinner and exchange gifts. And after the kids are in bed, Nate and I put out all the Christmas presents under the tree.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong> Christmas Day. We get up, open gifts and I make a nice breakfast. This year Nate's friend from his old job, Darshan, will be joining us. He came last year too. He is from India and doesn't have any family here to spend Christmas. We have church at 1 p.m. for only an hour. Yay! And then we head over to my grandma's house for a huge feast and gift exchange.</p>
<p><strong>Monday to Wednesday:</strong> Nate and I planned a little family trip to Gatlinburg. We are only staying a couple nights. It'll be fun to tour around with the kids there. None of us have been there before.</p>
<p><strong>Thursday:</strong> Unpack and do some chores around the house.</p>
<p><strong>Friday:</strong> We have the missionaries over for dinner.</p>
<p><strong>Saturday:</strong> New Year's Eve. We have a party that evening at our friend Babette's house.</p>
<p><strong>Sunday:</strong> New Year's Day. We switch to early morning church. Yikes. And we have friends coming over for dinner and game night that evening.</p>

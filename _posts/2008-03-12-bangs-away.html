				I am trying to let Kenzie's bangs grow out, which has become a test of patience for me. It is at that length where it hits her eyes and she lifts her head up to see out from under her bangs. And to me, she looks like a shaggy dog, making picture taking not as cute if you can't see her big brown eyes. Let me just say, all of you who are thinking, "Why don't you just use cute hair clips to pull back her bangs?" I have had those same thoughts and it doesn't work. She immediately pulls out the hair clip, even with a lot of coaxing with statements about how cute her hair would be with a bow in it. But tired of her not being able to see, I finally pulled it back with hair bands. And although it looks funny because her hair is so long and it looks like a huge pom pom on her head, it took care of the sight problem. You see, the interesting thing about her hair is the way it grows... she has two crowns at the back of her head going in opposite directions. So her hair naturally falls forward pointing to the center of her head... it would be good for a mohawk. And in the back, she gets curls, more when it's wet or humid. So that's Kenzie's hair dilemma, which makes it my hair dilemma. I had her wear the same clothes in the pictures for a more accurate comparison. Let me know which hair style you prefer.</p>

<p>I have been mentioning our trip to Washington for a while now. We flew out to Washington to visit Nate's family for their family reunion. It has been over 7 years since all 8 kids have been together. The last time they were all together was at our wedding. Since then, they've had someone on missions or study abroad, graduated from college, moved all over the country, and a few have gotten married and have had children since then. So it has been a busy 7 years for the Birds.</p>

<p>The twins just got off their missions from Honduras and Chile the week prior to the reunion. Two of Nate's siblings recently got engaged both getting married in August. Unfortunately, we won't be able to attend either one of their weddings because that is around the time when I will be in the hospital having a baby. And Nate has another sister who is dating someone pretty seriously and we have yet to meet him. So this was the reunion to meet all these new additions into the Bird family.</p>

<p>Nate was able to get some time off work. Although we are completely out of vacation days, holidays and sick days for the rest of the year. And I flew at 33-34 weeks of pregnancy. The doctors say not to fly after 32 weeks. But when we asked the doctor about flying a few months ago, he said he would leave it up to me to decide if I should go on the trip or not. There's no risk in flying, it's just I could have the baby and be without my doctors. Well, we flew and got back OK. Thank goodness.</p>

<p>We flew direct flight to Seattle and spent a portion of the day there with Nate's parents. To read about our experience flying 8-months pregnant and with two kids, <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2011/07/adventures-of-modern-mom-flying-with-kids/" target="_blank">go here</a>. They took us out to eat and to the aquarium. We had a few hours to spend in Seattle before going back to the airport to pick up more siblings who were also flying into Seattle later that day. The girls had a great time with their grandma and grandpa at the aquarium. It's a smaller aquarium but still plenty of stuff for them to do. After the aquarium we drove 2 1/2 hours to Nate's parents' house.</p>

<p>The Seattle Aquarium was pretty cool. It wasn't as big as the Atlanta one, but it was just perfect for the 2 1/2 hours we had to spend there. The girls had fun with Grandma and Grandpa looking at all the sea creatures. It was just what they needed before getting back in the car to drive to Nate's parents' house. They were able to run around, play with things and see new things.</p>

<p>That is a picture of Kenzie walking to school when I dropped her off at school the Monday after the elementary school shooting in Connecticut. The shooting actually took place while I was at Kenzie's school helping out with her class party. I didn't know about it until later that afternoon. What a sad event that happened to those children and school staff who were all killed. I couldn't believe it. Those children where Kenzie's age. I was happy to pick her up and have her home with me that weekend.</p>
<p>Dropping her off again on Monday was a little hard. I had a pit in my stomach the entire way to school. Nate and I decided not to tell her what happened. If she heard it somewhere or from someone else, that was fine and then we would talk to her about it. She's too young and we didn't want her to be afraid of something she loved so much.</p>
<p>I know one of moms first thoughts after learning about the tragedy Friday is, "How can I protect my children and prevent something like this from happening to them?" And perhaps homeschooling comes up as an option. We don't homeschool our children for many reasons. But in regards to what happened Friday, more children die in car accidents than in rampaged school shootings and I don't keep my children from riding in cars. I know it is hard to have faith in such a harsh and messed up society. But I know I can't protect my children from ALL harm. If I tried to shield my children from everything I think is wrong with the world, they would be locked in their rooms all day and never learn to deal with world and life issues that they will face even as adults. So I keep praying and keep doing what I can to bring a positive to the world. And I teach and prepare my children the best I can. And to hug and tell them how much we love them each day.</p>

<p>
				The week before school began I tried to get the girls and I on school schedule. I actually wrote out a schedule to figure out when we need to get up, eat meals and such for when Kenzie is in school. I called it the impossible because when the third child arrives, this schedule is pretty much impossible for me to juggle. I can't imagine when the girls are older and are in more extra curricular activities and such.</p>
<p>Right now, the impossible schedule looks a bit like me waking up at 5 a.m. to feed the baby and get ready for the day. Waking the girls up at 6 a.m. to get them ready and fed. Take Kenzie to school (Yes, not bus for us. At least not now.). Laney will have dance classes on Tuesday mornings. Kenzie will have dance classes Tuesday after school. All our meal times have been moved up an hour. Nap time for Laney is now at 11:45 a.m. instead of 1 p.m. And the baby, when she arrives, will need to be fed and napped in three hour increments. The hope is I can get to bed by 10-ish each night because I am not pretty when I don't get 8-9 hours of sleep. But with a newborn, I will be sleeping in 1-2 hour increments each night. That should be interesting.</p>
<p>Here's a picture of Laney falling asleep on my lap as I read the girls some books. I was falling asleep reading to the girls and Laney, she's not one for falling asleep in my arms but this day she did. It was the week we were trying to adjust to school schedule. It was more than rough on all of us. When Nate came home from work, he just laughed when I told him what happened. He thought it was funny that we were all so exhausted and school hadn't even began.</p>
<p>P.S. We are getting better with the new schedule now. I am still not enjoying getting up so early in the morning. But I'm getting a lot more done in the mornings. Yay.</p>

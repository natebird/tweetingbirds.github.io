				Tiffany: Kenzie, can you help me hold this? [handing her the saran wrap]<br />Kenzie: [handing the saran wrap back to Tiffany] Mom, can you hold this? It's too scratchy for me to hold.<br />Tiffany: Then can you help me hold the tape?<br />Kenzie: [handing the tape back] Mom, can you hold this? It's too sticky for me to hold.<br />Tiffany: Kenzie, you're just full of excuses aren't you?<br />Kenzie: I am. I can't hold big things. I can only hold little things that are not scratchy or sticky.		</p>

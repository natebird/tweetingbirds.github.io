				I tried to paint Laney's toes once before. She didn't like it. She only sat still long enough to do one foot. But this time was different. She browsed through my selection of nail polish colors. Then she came to me with the nail polish and said, "Toes." She sat down and let me paint her toes. All 10 of them without a fight. When she was done, she was so happy about it. It was cute. I love her cute little painted toes.</p>

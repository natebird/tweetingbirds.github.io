				Yesterday.</p>
<p>Kenzie [calling up the stairs]: Mom, I need to talk to you.<br />Tiffany [came down the stairs]: Yes, Kenzie. What do you need?<br />Kenzie: You need to trust me.<br />Tiffany [surprised by the comment]: Oh, yeah? I trust you.<br />Kenzie: I need to trust you, too.</p>
<p>I wasn't aware of any trust issues between the two of us, but I'm glad she talked to me about it. She watched "Super Why" yesterday and the story was "The Boy Who Cried Wolf." The moral of the story was trust. That prompted our talk about trust.		</p>

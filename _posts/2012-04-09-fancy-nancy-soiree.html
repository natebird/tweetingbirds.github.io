				A few months ago we attended a Fancy Nancy Soiree at the local library. It was quite fitting because Kenzie had been reading a lot of Fancy Nancy books for school AR tests. It was fun for the girls to get all dressed up. They had a fun story time where everyone dressed up and they read a couple of Fancy Nancy books then did a couple crafts. It was also great that Laney saw a few of her dance friends there too.</p>

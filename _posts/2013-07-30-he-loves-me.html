<p>Nate loves me. I've been wanting to eat some French macarons. I don't dare to try to make them myself. Nate came home one Friday after work with a box of these in hands. I haven't had these since our San Francisco trip. They were delicious. It took me several days to finish them up. But that's part of the problem with this summer. Too much yummy food and no exercise. I've gained so much weight from this summer alone! Ugh. 		</p>

				The girls were getting in the van while I put Lai LaiÂ in the car seat to head out to school in the morning. Laney opened the middle console in the van and found a container of green apple TicTacs. She grabbed some and ate it quickly. When she saw me coming in the garage, she ran back to her carseat and pretended nothing happened.</p>
<p>Laney: Mom, I found some green sprinkles. It was delicious.</p>
<p>Tiffany: I saw you eat it.</p>
<p>Laney: [sounding suprised] Huh? You saw me? I was trying to hide it from you!		</p>

I have been putting this off for a while after one previous short, two day, attempt at potty training back in July. I think this has got to be the most difficult thing a parent has to teach their children. Even the sex talk would have to be easier than this! Here's my thing about potty training… Do I really want her out of diapers, other than the fact that it'll save me money? I mean, it's nice to be able to change her when I have a moment compared to having her tell me when we are in the store that she needs to go pee pee. Then it's a ticking bomb race against time on how long I have to find the nearest bathroom, ditch my shopping cart items, and speed into a stall before an embarrassing mess occurs. Or having to remind and check to see if she needs to go to the bathroom every so often. Then clean up after and accidents. Really? This is supposed to make my life easier?! I know, I'm just being selfish and inconsiderate of my child's learning and growth progression.</p>
<p>OK, after all that, I borrowed the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Toilet-Training-Less-Than-Day/dp/0671693808/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1227580345&amp;sr=8-1">"Toilet Train in Less Than a Day"</a> from the library and read it in less than a day. It was a wonderful book that gave me a step-by-step plan, back up plans, what to do in certain situations, answers to some questions I had after my first failed attempt, and so much more. Although, after the first day, I still don't consider Kenzie fully potty trained, I would say that the book still provided me with great potty knowledge and gave me the confidence to pursue this daunting task. I would recommend this book to any parent with potty training in their near future.</p>
<p>I also had the idea that I needed to throw a potty party to get Kenzie psyched and motivated about potty training. And since she is into Disney princesses and pink right now, I choose that as the theme. I kept it cheap and simple by just getting a party banner, a princess cup, a pink cup, special drinks and special snacks. Thanks to the contribution of Nate’s parents, Kenzie got a fancy Baby Alive potty doll to assist in the training program. I also found some baby bloomers at the thrift store that I took apart and made into a smaller size as panties for the potty doll. Finally, I borrowed a bunch of children’s book and a DVD on potty training from the library.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSwy85XAKBI/AAAAAAAACwo/8dxv0E-T0CM/s1600-h/IMG_9365.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9365.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272645285514848274" /></a><br />Sunday night, Nate helped me decorate the living room and set things up for the party.  I kept this all a secret from Kenzie so it could be a surprise party.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSwy8vjoEPI/AAAAAAAACwY/Fs9FK7Qv4dQ/s1600-h/IMG_9362.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9362.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272645282883440882" /></a><br />Monday morning, Kenzie got up and Nate brought her downstairs to show her the surprise party. She was so excited about all the princesses and pink everywhere. I made her a special breakfast, pancakes with strawberries and whipped cream. After breakfast I introduced her to the party, showed her the potty doll, and told her we were going to learn how to be a big girl today.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSwy9VJnmTI/AAAAAAAACw4/TRzyoTlgwEE/s1600-h/IMG_9372.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9372.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272645292974905650" /></a><br />All day long I offered her special drinks - strawberry milk or raspberry soda that I called Special Princess Drinks - to provide many potty moments. I also offered salty snacks to make her drink more.</p>
<p>I began the training by showing her the doll and using that as a visual aid teaching her the process of going to the toilet having Kenzie assist me. Then we practiced having Kenzie sit on her toilet.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSwzcA6hrFI/AAAAAAAACxA/uPNxyuL_DII/s1600-h/IMG_9373.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9373.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272645820118838354" /></a><br />The first time she sat down on the toilet, she did a #1! And throughout the day, she had three accidents but went in the toilet five times, including two #2s. She did end the day on a high note with a combo #1 and #2 right before bed. For some reason, she has a harder time with the peeing. Kenzie has learned to pull her pants down and up by herself. But she is still not self sufficient enough to tell me when she needs to go or go all on her own. We will be working on that the next few days.</p>
<p>Regarding rewards and treats, I offered her one the first time she went in the toilet. But since then, praise has been enough for her. Since she is having a harder time with going pee pee in the toilet, I set up a potty chart today and offer the incentive of a trip to Puo Puo and Dudepa’s house (my parents) when she can pee pee in the toilet all the time with no accidents. I tell her that Puo Puo and Dudepa likes girls who can pee pee in the toilet and not in their panties.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSwy9D9TGoI/AAAAAAAACww/mV3no0fjtHY/s1600-h/IMG_9367.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 240px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9367.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272645288359828098" /></a><br />The whole day, we read potty books, watch potty DVDs, and made fun princess crafts. I had a bunch of fun princess crafts and activities set up, but we only got to one of them, the cookie and pretzel necklace. We'll probably do the other activities throughout the rest of the week. I had cleared up my entire day to focus only on Kenzie and potty training. The only break I had was when she went down for a three hour nap, a sanity saver for me.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SSwzcuLPnnI/AAAAAAAACxQ/fp7RTHvKgxw/s1600-h/IMG_9376.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9376.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5272645832268553842" /></a> Here Kenzie is eating her co<br />

<p>Since this is an on going process, I’m sure I’ll be writing more on this in later posts. Wish me luck! Let me know if you have any tips on motivating a girl be self sufficient enough to pee pee in the toilet. Today, she has found it a joke to pee in her panties. I think she is doing it for the attention.		</p>

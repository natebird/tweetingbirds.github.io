				We had the paint for the kitchen for a while now, but just didn't get around to it before school started. So the first school holiday, I took advantage of Nate being home. We painted all day on Labor Day - irony? I haven't taken a picture of the results because I am still undecided about my feelings toward the color in the kitchen. The problem is not the color, I love the color. But I'm just not sure I love the color all over the kitchen and the dinning room. It's a lot of green - bright green. I have decided we can use the other half gallon in parts of Kenzie's room as her room is going to be green and purple. Side note: I have big ideas for her room including stripes, which also means it probably won't get done until Nate is out of school or over Christmas holidays when he gets three weeks off school, but not work.</p>
<p>You can get a taste of the color in one of the pictures below. I like the green because it's a modern green. Green can be tricky as I didn't want it end up being puke green. I'm giving it a few days and seeing how it goes. If I like it after a while, I'll post the result picture.</p>
<p>Once again, Kenzie was a trooper throughout the whole process. Although, we did recruit for extra help this time. We had my brother, Jeffrey, come over to help us do some painting and watch Kenzie.</p>

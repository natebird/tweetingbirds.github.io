<div style="text-align: justify;">I don't wear eye glasses often, only when I take out my contacts. However, I got my first pair of glasses my freshmen year in high school. That's when I noticed I couldn't read the chalkboard from my seat, and I was getting headaches from squinting all the time. The style of frame I picked out went quickly out of style as it was the cheapest one my parents could find. That went into a museum of out of style glasses.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">The second pair of glasses I accidentally backed over with my car as I drove out of the driveway after seminary. We had seminary at my seminary teacher's house. It was my senior year in high school. I had the glasses in my pocket of my jacket. It fell out when I got something out of the trunk of my car.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">And my most recent pair lasted me from my senior year until just 5 minutes ago when I heard a snap behind me. I was sitting at the computer editing my last article on my blog. Nate was supposed to be watching Kenzie. The two of them were in our bedroom. Then I heard a snap behind me. I looked over my shoulder and there was Kenzie holding my glasses in two pieces. </div>

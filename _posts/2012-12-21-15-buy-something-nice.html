<p>I bought myself something really nice. I upgraded my camera. I found a really good deal on a new camera that saved several hundred dollars. I also had some money saved from my blog. And then I am planning on selling my old camera and the kit lens that came with the body of my new camera. It's a lens I already have. So that will all help cover the cost of the camera. Not bad. I'm excited about the camera. It will get a little getting used to though. This new one is heavier, especially with my lenses on it. It's bigger. It has different features and functions. I read the manual to try to learn it. It has different buttons and knobs. And the pictures are pretty awesome. In a way I feel like I need to do more photo shoots with it of other people. Do what this camera is supposed to do.		</p>

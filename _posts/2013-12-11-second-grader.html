<ul>
<li>Absolutely love her teacher! Mrs. Chan is so nice and works great with Kenzie. She also has Mrs. Carr for reading and math. She is in the highest group for reading and math.</li>
<li>Has 28 kids in her class. Yikes!</li>
<li>Out in the trailers. This one makes me nervous and the fact that they keep going in and out of the building for specials, lunch, library, and when the weather is bad, they move into a classroom inside. It gets complicated in the winter when they have to bring their jackets everywhere.</li>
<li>Tested well at the beginning of the school year and got into the highest reading and math groups. She also reads at 222 wpm and has over 90 AR points by beginning of November. She'll finish with AR before Christmas.</li>
<li>Qualified for AIM (gifted program). Started AIM in November. They took the CogAT test earlier this year and her scores were near perfect in two of the three categories. And still 80% above average in the third category. So she qualified for AIM and loves it. They get to do special projects and learn at a higher level. She has lots of friends in AIM with her. A bunch of the kids in her math and reading groups.</li>
<li>I go in her class on Mondays to help her teacher for an hour while Laney is at speech. Lai Lai comes with me as mom's helper. We only get to see Kenzie for a little bit then they go on a potty break then head off to math groups. But it's OK. I get to know her teacher better and help out with stuff here and there.</li>
<li>She has some good friend in her class. But her best friends are not in her class but in the same pod. So they at least see each other at recess.</li>
</ul>
<p>Meet and greet at school to find out who her teacher was. She was so excited to get Mrs. Chan. She said she was hoping to get Mrs. Chan. We were all excited for her to get Mrs. Chan.</p>

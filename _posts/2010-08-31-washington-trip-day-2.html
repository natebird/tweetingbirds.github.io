<p>Nate's parents live about 2 1/2 hours away from Seattle. But they awoke early Tuesday morning to meet us in Seattle. They couldn't wait to get their hands on their two granddaughters. I have been to Washington four times now and haven't toured Seattle. So I wanted to drive around and do some sightseeing in Seattle this time. Nate's parents, Randy and Cyndi, drove us all over Downtown Seattle while the kids napped in the car.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1619" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/08/washington-trip-day-1/img_5159/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1619" title="IMG_5159 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5159.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>I loved Seattle. The place was gorgeous and so full of vibrancy. Every building and home had beautiful architecture. It was too bad we were driving around most of the time because I would have loved to take pictures of all the fun buildings. Nate and I watched the movie <em>Love Happens</em> last weekend and the movie was based in Seattle. It was so cool to see all the places we visited in the movie.</p>

<p>When the kids woke up from their nap, we stopped to eat at a fish and chips place called Ivar's. As soon as I stepped out of the car, I could smell the salt water breeze. I loved it. Totally brought back memories of my childhood in Hawaii. We ate outside with the seagulls and gorgeous water view. That was loud. But the kids had a great time tossing fries at the seagulls. The food was delicious. I haven't had much fried fish and it was good.</p>

<p>Here you can see my short haircut. I got a trim before I left for our trip. It was little shorter than expected, but I'm getting used to it now. Plus my hair grows so fast that it'll be at the perfect length in about two weeks. We also walked around a couple souvenir shops where Laney managed to break a glass magnet. Ooops.</p>

<p>After lunch we went to Pike Place Market, a huge outdoor farmer's market. I love flea markets and farmer's markets and antique markets. I wished we had more of them in Georgia. They had delicious fresh food and huge flower bouquets for really cheap. We only had enough time to walk the top level of the market. Apparently there were some wholesale fabric stores that we didn't get to. Probably for the best since we didn't have any room in our luggage for me to bring anything home.</p>

<p>Most of these flowers were $5-10 for the bunch! Cyndi bought some to take home. They were breathtaking.</p>

<p>Cyndi, had so much fun looking for things to buy the girls. Laney got a handmade wooden toy car and Kenzie got the perfect thingâ€¦</p>

<p>After the market place, we went back to Jared and Angie's house while Nate's parents went to the airport to pick up more of Nate's siblings. Nick and his wife Jessica and Matt flew in on Tuesday afternoon. We all met together at Jared's house and ate pizza before heading back to Nate's parents' house. We hit a little traffic on the way home, but not too bad. We arrived around 10 p.m. The kids didn't really sleep much on the way home, so they were ready for bed that night. Still woke up at 6 a.m. though.</p>

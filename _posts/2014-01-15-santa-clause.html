				This year we just did the Santa at the church. Kenzie's school didn't have a holiday party this year with a Santa that came. The girls were super excited to see Santa. We pulled up to the church and Laney said, "I don't see Santa's sleigh!" Then the older girls noticed Santa's beard got pulled down a bit when a kid leaned on him for pictures. So they figured that wasn't the real Santa. But they still had fun sitting on his lap and talking to him. Lai Lai was intimidated by Santa. She was excited to see him but when it came time to sit on his lap she froze. She didn't cry, just straight face and didn't say a word. But afterwards she excitedly told everyone she saw Santa.</p>

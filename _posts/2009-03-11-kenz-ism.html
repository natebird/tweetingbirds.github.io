But I'll miss you when you go to school because Mommy can't go with you. You have to go all by yourself.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> You will miss me?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> Yup. But we'll have fun together when you get home from school.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> I have an idea!

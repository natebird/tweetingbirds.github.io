				Stomach flu. Our little household of three has been plaque with the stomach flu the last few days. It all began with Kenzie on Friday (just the day that Nate decided to go back to work for a "few" hours). She then gave it to Nate on Saturday night, causing him to spend majority of the night in the bathroom up chucking. That also kept me up because he is a loud up chucker, and every time he would get back in bed, I would ask if he needed anything. It was a rough night for the both of us. Sunday no one went to church since Kenzie still had to stomach flu, Nate couldn't get out of bed, and I began to feel sick to my stomach with a portion of that flu. Needless to say, I spent a lot of my time this weekend cleaning up messes coming out of everyone and making Gatorade runs to keep everyone hydrated (including myself). At least I didn't have to do any cooking since no one was in the mood to eat anything.		</p>

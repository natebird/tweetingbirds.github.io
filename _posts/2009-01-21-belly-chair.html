				Still no baby, and that's a good thing. I am hoping to last until next Thursday. Although, I thought I started labor by sweeping and moping the floors earlier today. My due date is next Friday, so 9 more days.</p>
<p>Last weekend we were able to put up a few baby things and rearrange our room for the bassinet. I went through Kenzie's newborn clothes and got a little freaked about how little she used to be. Going through baby clothes, I realized that Laney doesn't have any winter newborn clothes. So that's another thing to add to my list of to dos.</p>
<p>Today, as I am typing up this blog, Kenzie decided to use my belly as a chair as she sit here with me at the computer. Yesterday she started getting a stuffy nose. Not good. Hopefully it won't turn into bronchitis as I bring a newborn home. I pulled out the antibacterial wipes, antibacterial hand wash, saline nose solutions, and Vick's baby vapor rub.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SXd63xUU0VI/AAAAAAAAD_c/CVwwOfA6GIY/s1600-h/IMG_9709.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 240px; height: 320px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9709.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5293834985547288914" /></a>		</p>

				<span style="font-weight:bold;">Friday:</span> Making a crazy amount of cream puffs for the YW camp fundraiser that didn't end up being auctioned off, but it was my guilty pleasure all weekend. Putting together and pulling off a successful fundraiser only with the help and dedication of my amazing counselors and secretary! We raised $613 for 8 YW to go to camp.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Saturday: </span>Tried to find a moment to catch up on YW stuff since I had been gone for a month. And planned a YW lesson for Sunday. Went to a friend's birthday party, taking over some cream puffs so I wouldn't eat all 59 of them by myself. <br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Sunday: </span>We blessed Laney at church with my family and grandparents in attendance. Went over to Scott and Stacey's house for dinner with the rest of my family and the sister missionaries. Sundays go by quickly with church starting at 1 p.m.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Monday:</span> Still trying to get in a routine. But so far, my routine has been: Wake up. Nurse. Make breakfast. Eat breakfast. Clean breakfast. Nurse. Make lunch. Eat lunch. Clean lunch. Nurse. Make dinner. Eat dinner. Clean dinner. Nurse. Get Kenzie ready for bed. Put her in bed. Nurse. Get myself ready for bed. Get myself in bed. Sleep for a hour. Nurse. Sleep. Nurse. Sleep. Nurse. Start over again. I try to slide in some cleaning, picking up toys, checking my emails, blogging, and returning phone calls into that schedule. But as you can see how easy it can be to leave things undone.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tuesday:</span> I took Kenzie to the library story time, just the two of us. She needed some alone time with mom. And she was super excited to come home from the library with two Disney princess movies, Mulan and Pocahontas (unfortunately in VHS. I wish our library would catch up with modern time).<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Today:</span> Kenzie is sick with a cough and cold. I'm praying that it doesn't develop into bronchitis like it has done all other 3-4 times this winter. I'm trying to keep her away from Laney without hurting her feelings. She loves to cuddle, burp, and swing Laney.</p>
<p>Pictures will be coming soon.		</p>

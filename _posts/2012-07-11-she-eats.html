				She's a good eater right now. All my girls are pretty good eaters around this age. Then they turn 2 and it is all downhill from there. She loves veggies, fruits and crackers and such. She is also a fan of yogurt and cheese. Although just recently she likes to do the windshield wiper on her highchair tray and swipe the food onto the floor. Not cool.</p>

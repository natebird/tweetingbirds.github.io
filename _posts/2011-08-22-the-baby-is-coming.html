<p>So last Wednesday I went in for my weekly checkup. I went in with only one concern. Since this time around I don't technically have gestational diabetes so the doctors said they would let me go a week over but no more than that. My concern was that I birth large babies. Kenzie was 9 lbs 2 oz and Laney was 7 lbs 14 oz. And they both came three days prior to their due dates.</p>
<p>With this baby, at my last sonogram (at 24 weeks) the technician said I was measuring a week early. My doctors are ones who don't schedule inductions until you are a week late. And the last two weeks at my checkups I was only dilated to 1 cm. Didn't progress much. I was worried that if I go a week after my due date the baby would be huge. Kenzie was 9 lbs 2 oz and Laney was 7 lbs 14 oz. And they both came three days prior to their due dates. My official due date with this baby is Aug. 29th and the doctor didn't move it when even when I was measuring a week early after my sonogram.</p>
<p>When I went in to the doctor last Wednesday, I met with a midwife and told her about my concern. She checked me and I was dilated to 3 cm almost 4 cm. So she stretched me to about a 4 cm to help me out a bit. She said the baby was 60 percent effaced and my body was preparing for the baby to come. I asked her if the baby felt big to her and she did say that she thinks the baby feels like she was around 8 pounds. Just as I expected. She felt large to me too. At that point I still had a week and half to go.</p>
<p>Before I left, the midwife said I could go into labor the next couple days. She suggested me going on a nice long walk to get the contractions going. She told me to keep my appointment for the following Monday in case I didn't go in labor they could check me then.</p>
<p>I went home and started to worry. I wasn't quite ready for the baby to come yet. I was definitely having contractions that day and the next few days. Nothing steady though. I had a lot of things to do before the baby come and I had plans for the weekend and such. My parents were gone for the weekend for my dad's triathlon in Alabama. So I decided rather than trying to get my contractions going, I would try to hold the baby in for at least a few more days so I can get some things organized and ready.</p>
<p>Then by Friday, I had most of the things on my list done. So I felt a little more prepared for the baby's arrival. I started to pace around the house to maybe get some contractions going. I got to 8 minutes apart on my contracts and that was it. I needed to get to about 5 minutes apart to go in the hospital. Saturday we went out to the stores to do more walking around. Nothing happened. Sunday I walked around the neighborhood. Nothing happened. At this point it is pretty much waiting for the contracts to come or my water to break.		</p>

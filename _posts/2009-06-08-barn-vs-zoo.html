				Last Friday, I told Kenzie that we were planning on spending some family time on Saturday morning going to the zoo for a family outing. Since Nate is gone four nights a week for school, Kenzie has noticed even more Mommy's night lately. Causing her to request more family time with both Mommy <span style="font-style:italic;">and</span> Daddy. </p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, what animals are we going to see at the zoo?<br />Kenzie: A pig. I love pigs. They are pink. <br />Tiffany: I don't think they have a pig at the zoo.<br />Kenzie: Yeah, they live in the barn.<br />Tiffany: So what animals will we see at the zoo?<br />Kenzie: Marty, Alex, Melman, and Gloria!</p>
<p>Yes, she has seen the movie, <span style="font-style:italic;">Madagasca</span>, quite a few times.		</p>

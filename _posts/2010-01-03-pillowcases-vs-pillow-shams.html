				The last time I did laundry, Nate helped me put our bed sheets back on our bed. I came into the room and saw Nate had put the pillow shams on our sleeping pillows. We don't have 2 sets of pillows on our bed, just the ones we sleep with. I laughed about that. He was wondering why I was laughing. I told him the difference between pillow shams and pillowcases. Oh. He didn't know. So he pulled the sham off only to have the pillowcases on the pillows underneath the shams. Hilarious!</p>

<p>This was the second time we attended the GPB family day. This year it went a lot better. Less of a crowd because they limited the amount of people who could attend. The girls got to meet Curious George and get a picture with him. I didn't bring my camera so this is from the phone. We didn't stick around to meet Cat in the Hat.</p>
<p>They also got their face painted. Which they both loved. Laney sat really still. The most still she has ever sat. They also had a few other activities like coloring, painting, making play dough and such. They had fun.</p>

<p>We also went to Ikea. Twice. Before and after the family day event. We got there in time for their $1 breakfast. Fed the whole family breakfast for $6. And then we came back to do some shopping for some stuff for the girls' room and eat lunch. I love Ikea food. It's delicious and they had a great deal on lunch that we got food for the 4 of us for $10. The kids had fun playing around and going through all their stuff.</p>

<p>And then we ended the day with this. How great is that?</p>

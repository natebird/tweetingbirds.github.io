<p>It's true. The day has finally arrivedâ€¦ kind of. Nate has a job. He has been doing contract work with a company in Utah, working remotely from home. But while we were on vacation in Washington, he received an offer from a company in Georgia. He will be commuting each day to downtown. The thing is that it's still contract work for the first 6 months, then they reevaluate for a full-time position with benefits. He starts Monday, Aug. 30. At this job, he will be doing programming work.</p>
<p>Here's the thing. He is still looking for other jobs. One that can top this offer and starts full-time position right away. He is still waiting to hear back from another company he interviewed with. And has a few other recruiters looking for other positions. He will keep applying for jobs that seem to be good opportunities for him. What kind of jobs is he looking for? Entrepreneur, organization behavior and efficiency and management type jobs.</p>
<p>So we're excited for this new start and this will also mean I will have to get up earlier each day and get used to not having him work from home. It has its pros and cons. Congratualtions, Nate! We're excited for you!		</p>

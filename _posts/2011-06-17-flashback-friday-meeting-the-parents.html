<p>Unexpectedly Nate's uncle Doug passed away from a brain aneurysm. His funeral was in Texas and Nate's parents went down for it. On their way back to Washington, they stopped in Utah to see their kids. That's how I unexpectedly I met Nate's parents toward the end of October, after only 3-4 weeks of dating. They were here for a Saturday and Sunday. We went hiking up Mount Timpanogos then out to eat for dinner at Brick Oven. Nate's siblings, Nick and Natalie, and a family friend, Alan, came along. I was nervous about meeting Nate's parents but they were so nice and kind right from the start. And the hike, well, let's just say that this girl who has always lived in low elevations had a hard time breathing going up such high altitude in Utah. But Nate was so good about staying behind with me and his mom was really good about not making me feel left out.</p>

<p>On Sunday, Nate's parents went to church with Nick. But after church, they realized they forgot to purchase food on Saturday for Sunday's meals. So I invited them over to my apartment and I whipped up random stuff I had in my apartment. I wasn't expecting to host a party of 6 with what was in my college cupboard. It was definitely an interesting meal of what I could put together with what I had last minute. We had a great time talking at dinner and after dinner.</p>

<p>The meeting with Nate's parents seemed like it went well. I liked them and they were so welcoming to me. I didn't think of much meeting Nate's parents because I've met parents of other guys I've dated before Nate. And they always loved me. And since Nate and I had only been dating for three weeks, I didn't think I was meeting my future in-laws.</p>

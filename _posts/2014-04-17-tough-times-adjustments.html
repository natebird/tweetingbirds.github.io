				I remember going from 2 to 3 kids was tough. And then I discovered that going from 3 to 4 was also tough. The hard part was I've got kids going all over the place and a newborn who ties me down to nursing every 3 hours. And the lack of sleep at night isn't helping either. </p>
<p>Also, with the last three kids, I've had a hard time getting enough milk to come in to fully feed the baby. So I've been having to supplement with formula, take herbal supplements that helps increase milk supply, and with Lai Lai and Nora I've had to take a medication called Reglan to help me increase milk supply. The bad thing about Reglan is that the side effect of it is depression and drowsiness. Luckily I don't already have postpartum depression or else it would cause sever depression and most likely I wouldn't be able to take the medication. It was still hard taking the medication for three weeks with the dosage decreasing each week. I am not used to being depressed all the time. It was hard for me to handle. I was tired all the time and had negative thoughts. My type of negative thoughts were thoughts of giving up on nursing and the feeling of being overwhelmed with all the things I had to and couldn't keep up with. </p>
<p>Luckily Nate was working from home and was able to help me a bit with running kids to school and various activities. And thankfully I got enough milk on the last week of medication and I actually stopped taking it a few days early. I did not like how I felt on the medicine. It was like living with a hazy fog and a cloud over me. I couldn't think fluently and wanted to sleep all the time. </p>
<p>Things got better once I stopped taking the medication and got more into a routine with the three kids and newborn. I also made a calendar with some small goals to work toward and look forward to. Then we schedule a beach vacation for the end of the school year. That will be fun. </p>
<p>Also a great blessing that Nora has been such a good baby. She actually started sleeping longer at night shortly after we got home from the hospital. She would sleep from 9 p.m. to 1 or 2 a.m. Then from 1 a.m. to 5 or 6 a.m. So I only had to get up once with her in the middle of the night. I was up at 6 to nurse her again then get ready for the day and the girls ready for school. I would put her in the car seat after the 6 o'clock feeding and put her in the car when we were ready to head to school. She would sleep in the car seat the whole time. I did the same thing with Lai Lai when she was a newborn. Then at 6 weeks old she started sleeping a 7 hour stretch through the night. That was so awesome! Now my sleep isn't too bad. I try to go to sleep early at 10 p.m., right after I nurse her and put her to sleep for the night. Then she wakes up around 5:30 a.m. to feed. Some times I go back to bed for a few minutes and other times I just stay up and start my day. I am still pretty exhausted by the end of the day because I don't get a nap in all day. </p>
<p>Because I am still trying to adjust to this new schedule and lack of sleep (I'm a person who needs a good 8 hours to function well). And I feel like I don't have as much time to spend with Nate because we usually stay up and spend time together after the kids go to bed. But now I want to go to bed when the kids are down. Also, I am trying to find a good medium of how to spend time with the older girls while attending to a needy newborn and getting things done around the house like cleaning and making meals and etc. Let's just say my house is hardly clean and I haven't been cooking much thanks to Costco frozen food section. </p>
<p>I am looking forward to summer when we don't have to be on such a strict schedule and don't have school and homework to deal with. Only 7 more weeks of school, but really only 6 for us because the last week of school they are out for Memorial day on Monday. Kenzie will go to school on Tuesday. Then we will take her out early Wednesday and Thursday for us to head to the beach. They don't have school that Friday. And Cyndi is planning on coming to the beach with us. I hope it will be warm at that time. Summer cannot come soon enough!		</p>

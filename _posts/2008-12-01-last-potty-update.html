<p>The results of my potty training attempt has been successful after the first week. I consider Kenzie potty trained after four days. I just have to applause and give myself a nice pat on the back. I feel four days is a pretty good accomplishment considering some horror stories I have heard from other moms. OK, enough self praise.</p>
<p>As you can see from her chart, she has been mostly accident free since Thanksgiving. Her main problem is she gets too involved in playing that she doesn't want to take time away from fun to go to the bathroom. That will take time to learn. Even when I ask her if she needs to go, which I only do if we are about to hop in the car or I see signs of her holding it in, she will tell me, "No, I can't go to the bathroom <span style="font-style:italic;">right now</span>."</p>
<p>Kenzie even did well in the nursery on Sunday telling her teacher she needed to go. And the last few mornings she had been waking up dry. She does get our attention in the mornings by saying, "I need to go to the bathroom!"</p>
<p>I did, unintentionally, test her Saturday night on our drive home from my parents' house. There was an accident on the road that blocked traffic completely. We had to take a longer alternate route home. In the middle of nowhere at around 11 p.m., Kenzie announced from her car seat her need to go to the potty. Not even close to getting home, we told Kenzie that we don't have a potty close by for her to use. She had to hold it. A second announcement of her need for the potty, I told her that she could go pee pee in her sleeping panties (pull-up training pants). We had changed Kenzie into her pajamas and sleeping panties before we left my parents' hoping she would fall asleep on the way home. In response to my suggestion of going in her sleeping panties, Kenzie said firmly, "No, I can't go in my sleeping panties. I have to pee pee in the toilet!" All that potty propaganda worked.</p>
<p>About 10-15 minutes later, I had Nate stop at Walgreens, the nearest opened facility with a bathroom, and I ran Kenzie inside to use the bathroom. To my pleasant surprise, she did not go in her sleeping panties, she held it until we got to the bathroom!</p>
<p>So, there is hope for all the moms out there who are thinking about potty training. The second day was definitely the hardest, but it all worked out in the end.		</p>

My favorite talk from this conference was by L. Tom Perry. I <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">LOVED</span></span> his talk. He talked about my life motto - I'm pretty sure he was directing his talk to me. He said when life bring on stresses, relieve it by simplifying. My life evolves around organizing, systemizing, and simplifying. There are only four things we need to live, by Henry David Thoreau, food, clothing, shelter, and fuel. Read the talk in its entirety <a href="http://www.lds.org/conference/talk/display/0,5232,23-1-947-2,00.html">here</a>.</p>
<p>I am going to try to simply our lives even more by:
<ol>
<li>Cutting back on the wants in our budget. We don't need a lot of things to live happily. Rather, I would rather make better use of the time we have together in making family memories.</li>
<li>Store up on our spiritual fuel. Dedicate more time to the things we need to do to improve spiritually.</li>
<li>Be creative and make due with what we have.</li>
</ol>

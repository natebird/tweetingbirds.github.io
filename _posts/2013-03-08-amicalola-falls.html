				In August Nate's brother Matthew and his family came to visit us for a few days. Matt and his family were on their way to Armman, Jordan, for a semester of study abroad for Matt's major in Middle Eastern Studies. Joy is a few years older than Matt and she is done with school. They were married a year ago last August and had a baby girl in July. The baby Nadya was 3 weeks old when they were here to visit. It was a great opportunity for us to see Matt since we weren't able to make it to their wedding in August (I was having a baby then). And we got to see their new baby! </p>
<p>We took them to Amicalola Falls for a little hike. None of us had been there before. We did their shortest paved hike so we can take strollers. It wasn't really a hike since it wasn't far enough to be considered so. But it was still fun to be outdoors and see the beautiful waterfall. </p>

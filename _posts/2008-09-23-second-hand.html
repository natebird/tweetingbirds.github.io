				Now, opposite of my last post. There are just some things I cannot buy new at retail price. It's just outrageous! Once again, some may disagree with my list.
<ol>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Children's books.</span> Do you know that 15 pages of pictures, few words, and colors can cost $8-$17 per book brand new? I do value books and that is one thing I will always purchase for my kids. But I have broaden Kenzie's bookshelf collection with hardly used books from the thrift stores for $0.33 to $1 each. And often times, they are the same children's books parents buy from the retail stores.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Bicycles.</span> Since none of us are striving to be the next Lance Armstrong, we found second hand bikes much more reasonable. Nate and I both got our bikes from the Salvation Army for $8 each, and I got Kenzie's bike with training wheels for $4 at the thrift store.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">Cars.</span> Mostly because we can't afford brand new cars. But also because Nate is the logical financial guru in the household who comes from a family that doesn't purchase new cars. It's the same argument you have heard in years, it loses it value once you drive if off the lot.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Baby clothes.</span> This one, I do purchase new sometimes. But when I can, I take hand-me-downs from friends or from thrift stores/yard sales. I find new or hardly worn baby clothes for much cheaper than retail. It is great because kids end up staining and growing out of their clothes so fast anyway.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Halloween costumes.</span> I have yet to purchase a costume for Kenzie. The store bought ones are nice, but I like the homemade ones because they are so creative! Kenzie's first Halloween she wore a onesie that said, "My first Halloween," that she got from a friend. Last year, she was a bumble bee - a costume that Grandma sent her. This year, I got fairy wings at the Dollar Store and made her a little pink and white tutu - she's a fairy.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">DVDs.</span> Very few times we bought brand new DVDs. If we purchased it new, it was on sale for less than $10. Majority of our DVD collection came from Blockbuster's previously viewed section. We get movies 4 for $20. And since Blockbuster guarantee their DVDs, if we ever have problems with it being scratched or unplayable, we just exchange it. Our last trip to Blockbuster, we bought 6 movies for $21.</li>
</ol>

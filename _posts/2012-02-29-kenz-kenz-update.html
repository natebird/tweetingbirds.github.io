<p>I can't keep up with these kids. They are growing up so fast. I am so proud of Kenzie and how well she is doing in school. He has progressed so much.</p>
<ul>
<li>She was one of the students picked as the student of the month for the entire kindergarten class for February. I think there were two for each grade. She got a certificate, an iHop coupon, a ribbon and a pencil from the principal. And the coolest part for her was when the principal said her name during the announcements. She said her friends kept talking about how awesome it was that she was student of the month.</li>
<li>Her reading and writing skills are amazing. She is reading at a much higher level than most kindergarteners. She's reading 1st grade level books by herself. And she loves to write stories which has beginnings, middle and end. And many times they are quite creative and funny stories.</li>
<li>She will be tested for the gifted AIM program at school in March. Her teacher submitted her name to be tested because she has been impressed with how quickly Kenzie has learned everything and absorbed everything the teacher says in class.</li>
<li>She has been having trouble with a boy in her class who has been saying mean things to her. But it has been a good learning experience for her in self confidence and how to deal with people who don't want to be her friend.</li>
<li>She love to read and write all the time. She is really good at sounding out words. Now she reads words and asks me what they mean. I need to walk around with a dictionary in hand because some words I'm not quite sure how to define it to a 5-year-old.</li>
<li>She is our sensitive child. She doesn't like to get in trouble and always does her best to choose the right.</li>
<li>She loves school and loves doing homework. She makes my life so much easier by wanting to do these things.</li>
<li>She is curious and always asking questions about how things work and about the world.</li>
<li>She is mom's big helper. She is handy to have around because she is so good at helping me with setting the table, taking care of her sisters.</li>
<li>She is good at making Lai LaiÂ laugh.</li>
<li>She still fights with Laney quite a bit because Laney likes to do things to annoy Kenzie. And Kenzie likes to tell Laney what to do.</li>
<li>She likes to play house and school. Just like her mom.</li>
<li>She wants to be an author and illustrator and dance teacher when she grows up.</li>
</ul>

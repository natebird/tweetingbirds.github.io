<p>It was a hot summer day. The girls were bored and getting on each other's nerves while I was trying to get stuff done… craft projects for Kenzie's birthday party. So I set up the turtle pool and attached the slide. The turtle is supposed to be for a sandbox but I refuse to buy sand. And I don't want it to be the neighborhood kitty litter.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1896" title="IMG_3793 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3793.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="374" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1899" title="IMG_3843 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3843.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>They had a wonderful time getting wet. Then I gave them yogurt popsicles from Japan. Yum! Laney's brain freeze face is the best.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1898" title="IMG_3817 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3817.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>

<p>Then when I went inside to grab towels they decided to get muddy. I tried to keep the pool clean, but it was pointless. They were having too much fun dumping dirt in the water.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1900" title="IMG_3851 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3851.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>

<p>At the end of the day I asked Kenzie if they had fun playing in the pool. This was her response…</p>
<p>tiffany: Kenzie, did you have fun playing in the pool outside?</p>
<p>Kenzie: It is was fun, especially when we stopped listening to you.</p>
<p>(They were dumping handfuls of dirt into the water.)		</p>

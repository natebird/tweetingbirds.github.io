				Even though Kenzie is still under the weather, she is still able to turn the house into a disaster. On Tuesday night her fever went back up to 102, the highest it has been. But Tylenol and sleep got her back to a normal temperature all day yesterday. But last night, her temperature accelerated to 100. I am grateful for Tylenol that keeps bringing that temperature down. Without a fever, she acted a little bit more like the Kenzie we all love. She whined a little less. However, she still wasn't up for eating much and she didn't want to take a nap at all yesterday. So I didn't get much done even though I had 20 fleece blankets to cut for mutual last night. I don't know how I was able to do that and cooked dinner last night, but I did... maybe because I let the house go as you can see in the pictures below. Unfortunately (maybe it was fortunately), I had to leave for mutual last night only picking up a little bit of the house. But my wonderful husband stayed home with Kenzie while I was at mutual and he even cleaned the house, did the dishes, put Kenzie to sleep and was cutting up strawberries for the both of us when I got home! How nice of him!</p>
<p>This morning Kenzie woke up extra early at 7:30 a.m., but without a fever. She ate a little bit of breakfast, and wanted to watch Super Why, her favorite show, all morning. Still grouchy and whiny, but my mom is coming over and she always gets Kenzie in a better mood.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">A little update on Nate</span>: He is finally taking the GMAT this Saturday! So he has been getting up early each morning this week to cram for the exam. He has been studying before, but this week is cram week. Hopefully he will do well and can get into the MBA for fall. And his work has been busy as he is writing a program for non-profit organizations. So he is up early to study and working until 7 or 8 or later each night... what a hard worker!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7RcbQScTzI/AAAAAAAABVI/V1JHCAgKyKM/s1600-h/IMG_7347.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7347.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5166856295799344946" /></a><br />The mess Kenzie made in the living room.</p>

She would put one in her mouth, chew and spit it out on the carpet.</p>

But this is what she looked like sick and hugging my leg while I was trying to make dinner.</p>

She loves to clean. Here she is wiping the stuff in our pantry.		</p>

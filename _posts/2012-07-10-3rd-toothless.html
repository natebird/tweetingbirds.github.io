<p>A third tooth came out for Kenzie. This was what I wrote on the SMM blog about tooth #3…</p>
<p>While I was away running errands, Nate texted me a photo of this little face. Kenzie had four loose teeth – two top and two bottom. She had already lost two bottom ones. So losing this one was her third. I was surprised that this bottom one came out because although it was loose, she had been work on wiggling the top ones. Come to find out, Kenzie and Laney were playing tug-of-war with a necklace. And yeah, Kenzie had the necklace in her mouth when Laney yanked on it. And out came the tooth.</p>
<p>It just so happened that the previous week we were at the library and borrowed this most adorable tooth fairy book called <em><a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0763621757/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=simmodmom-20&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=0763621757">Dear Tooth Fairy</a>. </em>After we return it to the library I will be purchasing one for me. It’s a book about a little girl who lost a tooth and had a letter correspondences with a tooth fairy asking her questions all children have about the tooth fairy.</p>
<p>So of course, Kenzie had to write a note to the tooth fairy. But here’s the thing. She wrote the letter to the tooth fairy right after she read the book. Before she had lost the tooth. And put it under her pillow without telling anyone. The next morning she woke up surprised to find the letter still under her pillow untouched. When she asked Nate about it, he quickly responded that the tooth fairy didn’t know about the note because there wasn’t a tooth with it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the night Kenzie had her tooth yanked out by her sister, Kenzie was so excited to put her tooth and her note under her pillow. She excitedly reported to us the next morning that the tooth fairy came, brought her a dollar and wrote her a letter that answered all her questions.</p>

<p>Tooth #4 came out on a Saturday morning (June 23). She said she bit something hard and it came out. This bottom one wasn't as loose as the top one but I'm glad this one came out next. She's cashing in on the money with tooth fairy. I think tooth fairy is going broke. When we went in for our last dental cleaning early June, the dentist said that Kenzie is going to have crowding problems with her teeth on the bottom. She will probably need braces. Great. And I'm sure Laney will need braces from sucking on her thumb.</p>

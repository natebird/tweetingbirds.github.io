				<strong>9 p.m.</strong> Kenzie threw up in her bed. Guess the omelet Nate made for dinner didn't sit well with her. Or she has some kind of acid reflux problem because this was the second time this happened. She said her stomach hurts and then she burps then pukes. First time was on Sunday as she went to bed. And last night it happened as she went to bed. Huh. Gotta figure this one out.</p>
<p><strong>12:30 a.m.</strong> Laney woke up because she wet her bed. She is trained to go potty at night but this was the second time this has happened since we got back from San Francisco a week ago. So not sure how to encourage her to get up and pee rather than doing it in her bed. Got to find a new way to motivate her. She wakes up when she has to go, she's just too lazy to get out of bed.</p>
<p><strong>2:30 a.m.</strong>Â Lai Lai decided she wanted to eat. She was sleeping through the night prior to her learning how to roll over. When she first learned to roll over it was from back to tummy. She didn't like to be on her tummy so she would wake up a couple times at night wanting to flip back over. Now she know how to flip both ways but still wakes up around 4-ish wanting to feed. She did this while we were in San Francisco and since we were all in the same room at the hotel, I didn't want to let her cry herself to sleep and waking up the other kids. I'm going to have to wean her from this extra feeding soon.</p>
<p><strong>6:15 a.m.</strong> Came much too quickly. Nate woke me up to get everyone ready for school. I'm.So.Tired! And Nate is working late tonight. He'll get home after the kids are in bed. So it's just me and the 3 girls.		</p>

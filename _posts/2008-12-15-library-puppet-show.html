Although they do have a selective collection of books for adults, they have a wonderful children's program for all ages. I take Kenzie there often to the story times where they read books, sing songs, do a dance, and make a free craft at the end. Every once in a while, they have a puppet show. This was the third one we have been to this year.</p>
<p>Kenzie loved it! It was a show about Santa getting sick right before Christmas and the elves helping to save Christmas. She still talks about seeing elves, Rudolf, and Santa at the puppet show. She also learned the song Jingle Bells during the puppet show as they had all the kids sing it.</p>
<p>The picture is of Kenzie going up to see the puppets after the show. She's the one with the long, dark hair and in pink, of course.		</p>

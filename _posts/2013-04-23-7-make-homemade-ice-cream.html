<p>We bought an ice cream maker last year. It was a long time ago. It sat in our cupboards for a long time. That's why I made it a goal to actually use it. I love ice cream, as you all know. So that's why I wanted to try making homemade ice creams. Well, I found a recipe with things we had at home. But the night we went to make it, I realized too late that we didn't have enough milk. So I ended up substituting it with my soy milk. That didn't work out well at all. The ice cream mixture didn't really freeze or cream. First attempt, major fail. Next time I will want to try a different recipe. 		</p>

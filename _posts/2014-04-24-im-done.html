				I hope these are not famous last words, but everything about this experience of having baby Nora confirmed to me that I am done having kids. This fourth one is my last one. I don't think I can handle more than four. During the pregnancy, although it was the easiest pregnancy, I was so done being pregnant. After the birth baby was rough, although I was on medication that made me depressed but even then, it gets harder as I have older kids going everywhere and still be there to meet the needs of a newborn. And call me selfish, but I look forward to the time when the kids will all be old enough (5 and older) for us to do some really fun traveling. And they are more independent. I will miss the baby stages but I also won't. I won't miss the lack of sleep or the feeding every three hours or the crazy amount of diaper changes. But I will miss how little and sweet and innocent they are. I am also excited to get my body to where I want it to be rather than always pregnant or recovering from pregnancy. I worked so hard before I got pregnant with Nora to lose weight, it was really hard mentally for me to gain weight for the pregnancy. </p>
<p>I ordered a Lisa Leonard necklace that I have always wanted but didn't know all the kids' names to put on it. Right before Nora was born, I ordered this necklace because it was on sale. I also had to commit to a name at that time. The necklace came shortly after we got home from the hospital and I love it. It is so perfect. I wear it with pride. </p>

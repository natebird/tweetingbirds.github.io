				We blessedÂ Lai Lai on September 25. We got approval from the bishop to bless her on a Sunday other than Fast Sunday. We wanted to bless her on a Sunday when Nate's parents were here. Nate likes to keep the blessing circle small, so he had my grandpa, my dad, his dad, uncle Scott and the bishop in the blessing circle.</p>
<p>And Nate wore his pink tie from Lai Lai. Each time we have a new baby, that child gives Nate a tie. It's a little tradition I do for Nate. He's getting quite the collection of pink ties.</p>

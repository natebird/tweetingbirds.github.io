<p>Soâ€¦ <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2013/02/kenzies-6th-birthday/" target="_blank">My parents got Kenzie a fish bowl with two fish for her 6th birthday</a> and the next day, one of the fish died. Call me heartless, but I just told Kenzie and Laney that the fish was dead. That's why it wasn't moving. They were okay with that. But I asked my mom where she got the fish and maybe we could go get a new one. We went and got a new one that same day. Also on that second day, I started breaking out in hives on my arm and legs. It was so weird. I could only remember two other times when I broke out in hives - once when I was a nanny in New York and I ate something funky. And the second time when we came back from visiting Nate's parents and I had done laundry at Nate's parents' house using fabric softener. Found out I'm allergic to fabric softeners.</p>

<p>Sorry if you are sensitive to "medical" pictures. But I broke out majorly in hives. And about an hour or two later, it would go away. Then randomly it'll come back some time later. It always just started in one or two places then spread and I could always feel it coming. This lasted about two weeks. I went to the doctor, they did blood tests. It all came back normal. He said sometimes people can just break out in hives for a couple of weeks for unknown reason or triggered by some type of allergic reaction. He said if it lasted more than two weeks then to come back and see him for further testing. I'm glad it went away in two weeks. Haven't had it since.</p>
<p>At first I thought it was the fish or the chemical we put in the fish bowl caused the hive. We dropped the fish at my parents' house for fish sitting for a few days. I still had hives. When my parents brought the fish back, both fish died the next day. So weird that we couldn't keep a fish alive.</p>

<p>A while ago I purchased a bowling deal on Groupon. I got a super great deal on 2 hours of bowling plus shoes for up to 4 people. Nate had wanted to use it on a double date with some friends but life got busy and we never ended up coordinating that. So right before the deal expired, we decided to go bowling for FHE with the kids. We went a couple weeks ago and had a great time. The girls were pretty much done after the first game. But we stayed and played two games to use up our 2 hours.</p>

<p>Thinking back, I don't think Nate and I have been bowling together. Nate is a pretty good bowler. And I took a bowling class at BYU (as a P.E. credit) so I'm not good, but decent. I can hold my own. So we had lots of fun bowling.</p>

<p>Except with me being 7 months pregnant, I quickly found out it's actually quite painful activity to do. The first ball I tried was too heavy, 11 pounds. I normally use a 10 pound ball and since I can carry things less than 25 pounds, I thought I would be OK. Nope. I was wrong. Sharp pain went through all the bottom of my belly and pelvic. I felt like the baby was coming out. The problem was when I bent over to swing and release the ball. So for the rest of the night I used a 8-pound ball. It still had some pain but not as bad. I was still able to get strikes and spares. So that was good. But then when it was hurting I wouldn't do so good. But when we got home and the following day I couldn't walk because it felt like my pelvic was bruised. My shins also hurt because while Laney was sitting on my lap, she kicked me a few times with the back of her bowling shoe. Those shoes have thick soles that really hurt. I got a couple bruises on my shin from her shoes. This was the most painful bowling experience I've ever had.</p>

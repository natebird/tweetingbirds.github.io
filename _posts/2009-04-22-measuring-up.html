<p>They are starting to share clothes already. How does a 2 1/2-year-old share clothes with her baby sister who is only 2 1/2-month-old? Simple, have the same size waist. Laney wears 3 month size bottoms as pants whereas Kenzie wears them as shorts. My curiosity brought out the measuring tape and my suspicions were correct. Laney's waist = 19". Kenzie's waist = 19.5".		</p>

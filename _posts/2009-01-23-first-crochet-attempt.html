				It has been on my list to crochet matching hats for Kenzie and Laney. So for the last few weeks, when I have a "free" moment, I have been immersing myself in the crochet language (Round 5 *1 sc in next 9 sc, sc2tog*. Repeat from * to * around-63 sts.) and practicing the different stitches.</p>
<p>My first attempt to make a baby hat turned out decent, but not good enough to keep. So I scraped that and decided to start on a hat for myself. It didn't take very long to make once I figured out the secret crochet - members only - codes. The flower took a few hours and many attempts as it was a bit more difficult to figure out the language. But I think it turned out pretty cute.</p>
<p>Now I have less than a week to do two caps with flowers for the girlies.</p>
<p>P.S. I decided to get a belly shot while the camera was out. This is me, today, at 39 weeks.</p>

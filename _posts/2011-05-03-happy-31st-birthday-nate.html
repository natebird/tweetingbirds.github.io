<p>It's Nate's big 31st birthday! He's still not used to the sound of 30-something. And the slight gray in his hair isn't helping either. I think he looks distinguished and sexy.</p>
<p>But seriously. He's the worlds' best husband. Ever. I've married the best man out there and he's also my best friend. We seriously have the best times together. And our girls love their daddy to the max. We are all so lucky to have him in our lives.</p>

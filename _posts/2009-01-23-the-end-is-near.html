				I went in for my checkup today. Nothing exciting. Not much changed since last week. I'm dilated to almost 3 cm. But I did set up a day to be induced - next Friday. I'll have to call in the morning to see if they have any openings. We had hoped for Thursday to be induced, but that's OK. A better doctor and midwife are scheduled for Friday. So it'll work out.		</p>

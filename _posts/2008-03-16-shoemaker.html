				My dad and I share the same love for shoes. Anytime my dad and I go shopping together, we have to stop in the shoe department or shoe stores to check out the latest and sales. He recently purchased a do-it-yourself shoe kit from Simple Shoes. He actually got it off eBay at a much cheaper price. But it's a kit with the shoe in pieces and you sew it together with the string and needles the kit provides. My dad had some trouble with the sewing part of the shoemaking process (that's pretty much the only part of the process), where he recruited my sewing skills to help him finish making his shoes. It was actually really fun to do! The shoe is actually really comfortable and lightweight. I'm wearing it around until my dad comes to get it.</p>

<p>The shoe on the left is the finished product. All the pieces to the right of the shoe is what it looks like when the shoe is in pieces.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R91vMB1qJhI/AAAAAAAABpU/YXr2hHQx-Lg/s1600-h/IMG_7748.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7748.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5178417398988547602" /></a>		</p>

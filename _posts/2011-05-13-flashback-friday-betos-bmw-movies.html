<p>These stories are going to be long. So you don't have to read these. I'm just trying to record them for personal history purposes. Continuing from the last Flashback Friday where I talked about <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2011/05/flashback-friday-walks-to-school-mariokart/">me beating Nate in MarioKart</a>…</p>
<p>So things with Ryan was getting to be too much for me and the whole on and off again wasn't working at all for either of us. I was on an emotional roller coaster and wasn't interested in keeping up with it. I finally ended things with Ryan for good and decided it was time to move on. It was tough since Ryan and I had been together for 11 months. We had a lot of the same friends. This was his last year at BYU as he was going to start medical school the following year. We were at that point in our relationship where we were trying to decide what to do next. He said he wasn't sure if he was ready to get married yet. I was only 20 years old had never imagined myself getting married that young. But after dating for so long you come to a point where you wonder where the relationship is going. And what will happen when he left for med school. So it was best for the both of us that we just ended things mutually and moved on for good.</p>
<p>I was going through a hard time with all this but thanks to my friends Julia and Jeff, they were there for me the entire time. [Side note: Julia and I had been best friends since fourth grade in Hawaii. Jeff and I were friends since my sophomore year at BYU. We were in the same ward. He was like an older brother to me in college.] Jeff also knew Ryan because we were all in the same ward at one point. Jeff never liked Ryan. Jeff protected me from some crazy guys I dated at BYU.</p>
<p>It was Friday night when Ryan and I ended our relationship for good. I had a ton of tickets to the BYU choir concert, Ryan was performing in it. I didn't want to go since Ryan and I just broke up. So I was trying to give tickets away. I called all my friends but all of them had plans since it was Friday night and the concert was in a few hours. I ended up calling the three guys and they weren't able to go. I asked them to call Taylor and Nate, their new roommates, to see if they wanted tickets. Taylor had plans since he was engaged.</p>
<p>One of the guys gave me Nate's number. I called him to see if he wanted tickets. He said he couldn't go to the concert, but he would watch "Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon" with me since he had never seen it. A few days prior I was at the guy's house asking one of them to watch a Chinese movie with me for my Mandarin class. None of them wanted to except Nate. But I thought he was just saying it to be kind. So when he brought it up during this phone call, I was surprised. I thought it was weird that here was a guy offering to watch a movie with a girl he didn't know. We set a time to watch it on Friday. It was strictly for class assignment.</p>
<p>Friday came and Nate showed up at my apartment. This was his second time over at my place. Neither one of us had eaten dinner so we went to Betos. I had no idea why we picked Betos other than the fact that it was close to where I lived. But that place was the worst place to eat in Provo. It's like going to eat at Waffle House here in Georgia. Yuck. We got it to go, we each paid for our own because it was not a date. Then stopped at Blockbuster to get the movie, which I paid for since it was for my class. And once again. This was not a date. We went back to my apartment to watch the movie, eat our dinner, then we ended up staying up talking for a long time, like 2 or 3 in the morning. And sometime during that night, we were talking about relationships in general and Nate said these famous last words to me, "I'm a slow mover." He was implying that he took relationships slowly when he dated girls.</p>
<p>Then the following week, I was to meet up with Grant and Jeff at their apartment but when I got there, Nate was the only person there. I was just going to do some homework while I waited for the guys. But Nate started talking to me. And somehow we ended up watching some BMW short movies on his laptop. When Jeff and Grant got to the apartment, they were wondering what we were doing alone together. Um, nothing. I didn't think anything of Nate because I was still getting over Ryan.		</p>

				I have some great friends and this year, we decided to take a girls only trip to the beach. I am lucky to have such great relationship with some of my YW girls while I was the YW president. One of them being Shae who is also my birthday buddy. She was at BYU during our birthdays but then we thought we would plan a beach trip for when she came home for the summer. We got planning and got a few other gals to join us. We rented a condo close to the beach and it turned out really nice! It was so close to everything - beach, shopping, grocery, restaurants, etc. We drove to Myrtle Beach on Thursday and came home Sunday early evening after attending church at Myrtle Beach. </p>
<p>We all had such a great time. We mostly hung out at the beach or if it was too windy there, we went to the pool. There was a tropical storm passing through while we were there. But that didn't damper our spirits. We still went out to the beach, relaxed, enjoyed each other's company, played games, and stayed up talking. We also had some time to go shopping and went out to eat a couple of times. We celebrated national doughnut day while we were there at Krispy Kreme. We are thinking of making this an annual thing. </p>

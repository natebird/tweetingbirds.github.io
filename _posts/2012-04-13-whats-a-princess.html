<p>Our thing is if Laney has an accident then she can't wear dresses or skirts because princesses don't have accidents. We've been working on her not waiting until the last minute to go potty. And we're also working on not having accidents at night. Well, earlier this week Laney had a little accident during the day. She had to take off her pink dress and tutu petticoat she wears under dresses to make it fluffier and trade it for shorts. Oh the crying and drama that came afterwards. Here are some comments she made about it.</p>
<p>"I can't wear my necklace and have my hair in a bun anymore. I'm not a princess."</p>
<p>"Now I'm Pocahontas. She's not a princess. She's just a girl."</p>
<p>"Now I'm a prince. Only prince wears pants."		</p>

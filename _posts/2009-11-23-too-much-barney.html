<p>
				Kenzie wanted me to read her stories in her little princess tent in her room.</p>
<p><b>Tiffany:</b> Kenzie, I can't fit in your little tent. Mom is too big.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> You can fit in my tent, mom. Just use your imagination.</p>
<p>She then proceeds to pick up the tent and put it over me. I fit. Just can't crawl through the openings.		</p>

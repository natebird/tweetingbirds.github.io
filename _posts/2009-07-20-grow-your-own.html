				Long ago, while Jeffrey was on his mission, he sent Kenzie a grow your own duck. It's one of those little animals that you put in water for a couple days and it expands 500 times its original size. But it's all gooey. It's one of those things that's fun to look at but not suitable for playing. <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/02/duck-tale/">Back when</a> she was still little, she wanted to sleep with that grow your own duck. </p>

<p>Just recently, she found another grow your own poodle we had in the house. She wanted to grow it. She thought it was so fun watching it grow in water. She eventually wanted to sleep with it. I don't know what it is that she likes about these grow your own animals. She played with this poodle so much that eventually it became decapitated and dirty. But even then she wouldn't let me toss it. She insisted on putting it back in water to clean it. I finally had to toss that thing one night while she was asleep hoping she wouldn't notice its disappearance. </p>

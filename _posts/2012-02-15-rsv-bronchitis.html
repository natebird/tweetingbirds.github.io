Poor Lai Lai. She has had a rough winter. She catches everything her sisters bring home from school and church. Over Christmas break, just after Christmas she got RSV and bronchitis. First it was Laney, then Kenzie with colds. And with her being only 4 months old at the time, the cold was the harshest on her being RSV then turning into bronchitis. Right when we got back from our Gatlinburg trip, I took her in the next day to the pediatrician. I wanted to make sure she was OK because she was starting to throw up every time I nursed her.</p>

<p>The whole time I was doubting myself thinking that she probably only had a cold and would get over it on her own. But when I got there, I was glad I took her in. She had bronchitis and tested positive for RSV. We were sent home with a nebulizer to do albuterol breathing treatments for her to help with the wheezing. Then we had to go back in a week to have her rechecked. After a lot of saline nose drops and sucking her nose out with a bulb then getting puked on several times a day and breathing treatments three times a day she over came it. When we went back in she was just fine. The doctor was excited to see how quickly she overcame it.</p>

<p>And because these three girls were sick during the holidays we had to cancel our New Year's Eve plans. We had a lot planned and at the last minute we had to drop them. So for New Year Nate and I just hung out at home. I think in the past 5 years, we have had a sick kid on New Year's Eve 2 of these years thus far.</p>

<p>Well, bring you to present day, she got sick again. A week before Laney's birthday, Kenzie came home with a cold from a kid in her class. Great. That's the fun of having a kid in school right? Luckily Laney didn't get it until after her birthday. I was afraid she would get it on her birthday and not be feeling good on her special day. So Laney got it the following week. I got it the week after Laney. And Lai LaiÂ got it the same week but later in the week as me. Once again, because of her age, she got hit the hardest. I took her in because she was doing the same as when she had RSV. It was bronchitis again. We started doing breathing treatments again but this time with steroids because this was the second time she had bronchitis in about two months.		</p>

				OK, this will be the last one I make of these shirt dresses for a while. Now that I have two girls, I have to make sure I make one for each. And since the first one I made for Laney didn't turn out as well, I had to do a second. This shirt was a Polo shirt from my dad. It had a pretty long rip on one of the side seams. I think it turned out pretty cute. My dad would be proud. The Polo symbol on the shirt fit with my pattern, so it's on the dress making it look like a Polo dress. I didn't leave the tag on though. It looks long in the front on her. I had to make it a bit longer since the diaper makes her rear stick out and the dress shorter in the back. What can I say? My little girl has some junk in the trunk. </p>

They are fun to do. I can't say I was the creative genius who came up with this idea. I saw it on a <a href="http://dana-made-it.blogspot.com/2008/07/tutorial-shirt-dress.html">craft blog</a>.  Although, coming up with the pattern is the tricky part. Watch for the sleeves. My pattern came out slightly different and I figured out simpler and easier way of sewing it all together than her tutorial.		</p>

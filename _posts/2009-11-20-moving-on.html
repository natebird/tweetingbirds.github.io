				<i>Laney crying.</i></p>
<p><b>Tiffany:</b> What happened, Kenzie?<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> I was trying to help Laney get on her walker but she didn't want to use her walker. Then she was trying to get my tea party. So I was trying to get her another toy. But she didn't want it.<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> OK.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> I was trying to make her happy but she didn't want to be happy. So it is not my problem anymore.		</p>

<p>
				Just because I don't have enough going on in my life right now, I decided to start up a new blog. My RSS feed is full of craft and sewing blogs that I follow. Lately, my head concocted a bunch of craft ideas and the desire to submerge myself in the crafting/sewing community. Leading to the new blog <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com">Simply Modern Mom</a>.</p>
<p>Simply Modern Mom is a blog where I post my projects and ideas. It's a place to collaborate on ideas. And a place to share inspirations.</p>
<p>Since my Simply Modern Mom blog is public, I have changed the names of my children and removed any information giving away my location. Please keep it that way.</p>
<p>But please hop over there and check it out. Leave lots of comments and put it on your RSS feed. Check the archives for past posts. I just started it yesterday, so not too much going on there.</p>
<p>Also follow it on <a href="http://twitter.com/simplymodernmom">Twitter</a>.
<div></div>
<div>And don't worry, this blog will stay the same. This is where you can read all about what we're doing. There will be updates constantly. So keep coming back.</div>

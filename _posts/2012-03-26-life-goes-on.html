				Here I go again. I am letting myself get even more behind on blogging about our lives here. I know there are a few of you reading this but I mostly write this blog for our family history. This is a way for me to record things that are happening with our family. It's our family journal. So I feel bad when I get so behind on blogging about what has been going on with us. There are still Christmas stuff from last year that I still haven't posted about. Don't be surprised if I have posts in July about Christmas 2011. Also not mentioning how I still haven't posted about Laney's birthday and such. Yikes. Feeling a little overwhelmed right now.</p>
<p>Life has been crazy busy lately. There are just so many things happening at once and I just don't have enough time for everything I need to be doing. So… a quick synopsis of what has been going on and the details and pictures will hopefully come soon.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nate has been working a lot lately.</strong> He works his normal job then comes home to work more in the evenings with side jobs. Right now he is doing a site for Deseret Books called http://prettydarnfunny.com. He got this side job from Justin, who he used to work for. And Justin said there may be a few other side jobs for them to do together. There are also a few other people who are asking Nate to do website and such for them. It's nice for him to have all this extra work and it's helping a lot to pay off debt. It really is a blessing at this time for him to have work at all. So we are so fortunate for these work opportunities. He is amazing for working all day, coming home to spend 3 hours with us girls and then go back to work for the rest of the evening.</li>
<li><strong>Nate's sister, Nicole, was getting married in San Francisco on March 17.</strong> The original plan was for Nate to attend the wedding himself since we couldn't afford for all 5 of us to fly out there. He had bought his ticket and was ready to go. It was just going to be a short trip for him, leaving Thursday after work and returning on Sunday.</li>
<li><strong>Nate's dad, Randy, discovered stage 4 bile duct cancer just a few weeks prior to the wedding.</strong> It actually took a week or so for the doctors to discover what kind of cancer it was. At first they just saw tumors in his liver. Being the oldest of all 8 children, Nate pulled together and had a family meeting with the siblings to see how they are doing handling this news. This news completely took everyone by surprise. And I think it took us a while to finally <em>get what was going on</em>.</li>
<li><strong>With the news of Randy's cancer, Nate and I decided it was important for all of us to be at Nicole's wedding</strong> because all the other siblings and their spouses were going to be there. It was the opportunity to get all 8 Bird children and their spouses (for those who are married) in the temple. That was something Randy and Cyndi have been wanting to make happen for a while now. So when we decided to head out and bought the tickets, it was a week and half before leaving for the wedding.</li>
<li><strong>I had a week and half to order wedding dresses for all of us girls, get other wedding stuff ready</strong> (shoes, jewelry, hair accessories, etc.), and get ready for a 5-day trip out to SF. And we had to purchase Nate another ticket so he could be on the same flight as the rest of us. No way I could have made it through the airport with all 3 kids AND all the luggage, car seats and strollers. I also had to make hotel reservations and car rental. Figure out what Kenzie was going to miss at school and such. Luckily there were furlough days for two of those days so she actually only missed one day of school.</li>
<li><strong>I have been helping out at Kenzie's school more lately.</strong> Being a room mom, I had been doing a lot of stuff from home. And lately I have been going in to volunteer in the classroom and even chaperone a field trip. And I know it's just going to keep getting busier with school since we are heading toward the end of the year.</li>
<li><strong>Redesigning Simply Modern Mom.</strong> I hired a designer to redo my site. As much as I love designing, I am not a designer. So I needed professional help. I hired Melissa, a friend of mine through blogging, to redesign my site. She is a fabulous graphic designer and she gave me a really good deal for redoing my site. Then Nate will work on the programming portion of it to get it up and running. It's going to look so good!</li>
<li><strong>Maintaining the house.</strong> So while we were in San Francisco, the seasons in Georgia jumped from winter to summer. Although we had a pretty warm winter this year, not even a drop of snow. So perhaps we skipped winter and went from spring to summer. Either way, when we got home from our trip we discovered gigantic fire ants in the house. They had a mound right next to the house outside in our backyard and there was no where for the ants to go but in the house. Luckily Lai Lai is not crawling yet. But still, I had the pest control people over immediately to take care of it. And also since Nate has been working so much, he haven't had time to take care of our lawn, which is also have problems with dead grass spots and such. So we shopped around to find lawn service help. That's part of making more money, right? You have less time to do maintenance things and start hiring people to do it for you. But then your money is spent on things like that and not fun things. Huh.</li>
</ul>
<p>Those are some of the things that has kept us busy here. And we have a lot of other things coming up. But it makes for fun times. We are in the process of trying to make some plans for the summer and the rest of the year. Although it's hard to make plans with the uncertainty of Nate's dad's health. It has been a fun year so far though!		</p>

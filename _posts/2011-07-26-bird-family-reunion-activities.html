				I was going to combine this post with the food, but it turned out I had about 50 pictures. I knew you weren't going to flip through 50 pictures in one post. So I decided to break it up. Hey, I took over 600 pictures just of the 4-day reunion. So be glad that I narrowed it down to these few in the posts. Hehehe.</p>
<p>There were a few major events planned for the reunion. Other than that, there were a lot of free times. That worked out well because people could plan what they needed to do or go see friends they wanted to see. We did try to start out each morning with a devotional and each evening with a family prayer.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4285" title="IMG_7824 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7824.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4286" title="IMG_7825 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7825.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>First thing we did was visit Grandma Critchell. She was Nate's grandpa's cousin and had been a grandmother to the Birds. She was on her death bed when we all arrived so we made it out to visit her as soon as possible. We wore our reunion shirts and brought her one just for her. And then we sang "Teach Me To Walk" as she loved primary songs. She taught in primary for many, many years. It was a very tender and intimate moment as we were all there to sing to her. She passed away that evening after her last son came to see her.</p>

<p>The girls practicing their song for sacrament meeting. The twins spoke of their missions and the three girls sang while Aunt Debi played the piano. The girls were so wonderful in their singing. Not one dry eye in the house.</p>

<p>The adults played at the big pool while our girls napped. So there was a little pool for the kiddos to enjoy. And the treehouse, hammock, chalk on the back deck, swings, a huge yard to run around barefooted, Lola (sheep) and horses in the pasture, crochet tournaments, naps with grandpa, a pedicure with grandma, painting with grandma, studying for the LSAT and so much more.</p>

				Last Friday I attended the high school graduation of three of my Young Women. Even though I am not in YW anymore, I still call them my girls. And I am glad that most of them still keep in touch with me even though I don't see them as often as I used to. And now they will be going off to college. So sad. I can't believe how grown up they are. It seemed like they just came into YW yesterday. Isn't that how it goes?</p>
<p>And I was super excited for Shae who spoke at graduation and was ranked 5 in her class. That's her face on the Jumbotron. She did such a great job in the good-bye speech. Shae is my birthday buddy, so we're close. We worked on her college applications together and I'm so excited that she will be going to BYU in the fall. Go cougars! She will be a nanny for a family in our ward this summer. That's why I did after high school, except in New York. It has been amazing to watch her grow and mature. When she first moved to our ward, she was very shy. And now she has been the one to go out and meet new people and make sure others feel included. She's just all around awesome.</p>

<p>Then there's Ashlen. She's such a cute girl with a fun personality. She is one of the most talented girls I know. She loves to do drama and is really great at art. Her drawings and artwork are amazing. She is one of those girls who is good at whatever she tries. She was in the school play, "Annie" this year. And she is looking to stay in Georgia for college.</p>

<p>Miranda is a very special girl. Her family has been inactive for a while but she started to come to church by herself. She started talking to Shae at school and started coming to stake dances and then church. She has been dancing for years. She got a full scholarship to University of Illinois where she will be going in the fall.</p>

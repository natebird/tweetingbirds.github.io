				We keep Father's Day pretty simple around here, especially this year. Nate's dad is gone. And my dad was in Taiwan with my mom. So we actually had Father's Day just at home with just us this year. It was nice. Nate bought a pressure washer the day before Father's Day. The girls made cards and coupons for Nate in Primary. And I made him his favorite meal for dinner. </p>

<p>
				Thursday <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/05/week-long-celebration-part-3/">our guests</a> left. And that evening Nate had a stake basketball game. I got out of YW that night so we could all tag along to Nate's game to watch him play. It was their last game of the season. Before the game, we picked up some free birthday ice cream at Baskin Robbins for the both of us. </p>

His birthday wasn't until Sunday, but Friday worked best for what we were doing. I managed to get my parents to babysit the kiddos while Nate and I went rock climbing with my brother. Jeffrey has been getting into rock climbing lately and he volunteers as a guide at a rock climbing gym. Nate had been climbing a couple times before and I had only done it once at a mall. I had wanted to go climbing for a while, so I thought Nate's birthday was a great excuse for the both of us to go. </p>
<p>We had so much fun doing it. We both did better than we thought we would since we were both out of shape. Jeffrey was a great guide in spotting us and teaching us some of the logistics of rock climbing. We also did some bouldering, which didn't turn out to be as scary as I thought it would be. </p>
<p>Then on the way home from rock climbing, we stopped at Cold Stones for our free birthday ice creams. Gotta love all the free stuff you get for birthdays. </p>

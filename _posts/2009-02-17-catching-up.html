				<span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 51, 153);">Laney:</span> Had her 2 week checkup today. She is one healthy baby. She has gained a little more than 2 pounds since birth, weighing at 10 pounds now. She will be three weeks old tomorrow. She does have a bit of acid reflux, but we are mainly keeping her more upright to help with that. She is already feeding every 3-4 hours and letting me sleep 4 hour shifts at night. I love sleeping babies! She is having a hard time falling asleep during the day for naps because she wants to nurse to sleep. I'm trying to get her to fall asleep on her own without any sleep aids.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 153, 255);">Kenzie:</span> Had a hard time at first with the adjustment to this new life as a big sister, meaning she reverted for about a week and half with the whole going to the potty thing. But she has been doing great with going to the toilet again for the last week. I'm glad that didn't last long. Still testing her limits, but she has been doing a lot better lately. She is one who strives on routine and familiarity.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(255, 204, 0);">Tiffany:</span> Still trying to catch up around the house and get into the groove of things. I need to pick up on a routine and stick to it, for my own sake and for the kids' sake. I have been working on organizing and slowly picking up things around the house. I have chores to do around the house, but I can't seem to get past the dishes and the kitchen. Other than that, I'm recovering well physically. I am also trying to catch up on some YW stuff for church since our stake realigned the boundaries of six wards, including ours, at stake conference last Sunday.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">Nate:</span> Keeps on looking for a job. Nothing has turned up so far. And he has come up to some road blocks for his own business. So he is strategizing and trying to work that out. He is back in school and doing great in that area. He has been a great help around the house and with the kids. I am grateful for all he is doing to help me out.		</p>

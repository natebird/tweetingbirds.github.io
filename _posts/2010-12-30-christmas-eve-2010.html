				Christmas Eve is full of family traditions. In the morning, we go over to Auntie Lori's house for her famous Southern breakfast. A bunch of the family go to her house, which for us is about an hour and half away. On the way there, I had this conversation with Kenzie…</p>
<p>Kenzie: Are we there yet?</p>
<p>Tiffany: Nope. We are about half way there.</p>
<p>Kenzie: This is like Disney World far!</p>
<p>It was totally worth the trek. The food was delicious. Local bacon, homemade buttermilk biscuits, eggs, sausage all smothered in gravy. Yum. She makes the best homemade buttermilk biscuits. They melt in your mouth.</p>

<p>After breakfast, the girls played with toys and played dress up. Then my cousin Jordan (Laney's birthday buddy) got her set up to help clean the kitchen. How appropriate for Cinderella to help out.</p>

<p>After breakfast, we headed home. The girls had naps and then got ready for my parents' to come. My mom made a turkey. Her first turkey ever. She also brought stuffing and gravy. I did the rest with scalloped potatoes, rolls, caesar salad and tomato, fresh mozzarella and basil salad. This was also Nate's first time carving a turkey.</p>

<p>After dinner, the kids were eager to open presents. They didn't even wait for us. They just started opening. So we went ahead for the gift opening. We kept it simple this year, which is great.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2724" title="IMG_2399 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2399.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2725" title="IMG_2401 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2401.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>

<p>My parents got the girls giant marshmallows. These guys are huge. I've never seen them  this big before. They are to use at my parent's fire pit. The girls love going over to their house and making fire in the fire pit with them. Each marshmallow, that's right just one, weighs one ounce. I can't even image the amount of sugar that's in that thing. I'll have to cut them smaller for the kids. That's right. I'm one of those moms who watches my children's sugar intake.</p>

<p>Then my parents opened gifts from us. This year, we wrapped up some of that Insta-Snow. It's powder that you add water and it makes snow. One little jar makes 2 gallons of snow. And we got my mom a car scent for her car from Bath and Body Works. And we also go them tickets to Snow Mountain with us to go snow tubing. We couldn't wrap the Snow Mountain tickets, that's why we got them the Insta-Snow for something to wrap and open. My dad thought that was hilarious. And my parents are excited to go snow tubing. They love doing stuff like that.</p>

				We did a lot of stuff this Christmas, include getting sick. Yeah, that was fun. Kenzie's last day of school she had waaaaay too much sugar and threw up that night. She was fine the next day. Laney got sick the night of Christmas after all the partying. I think she ate something that didn't sit well with her and it took her stomach a few days to get rid of it. No one had a fever. Then Lai Lai spit up in the car on our way up to Kentucky because she ate too much snacks in the car. She was fine right afterwards and had no other problems. Luckily Nate and I were fine and it wasn't a virus bug that kept everyone down for a few days.</p>
<p>Other than Legoland, the Nutcracker and the gingerbread house contest, we also made cookies for Santa on Christmas Eve. We also attended our friends' annual Christmas party where we ate delicious fajitas. Nate still laughs at the fact that our friends in the ward who we hang out with are older than us, like close to our parents' age. We taught their kids in Sunday school, YW and YM. We like hanging with the "older" people in the ward, much less drama going on there. And after Christmas I had a little game night with my YW girls who were home from college. We had the best time playing Nerts.</p>
<p>We had an elf visit our house again this year. This time it was a girl elf and her name was Dott. She had a polka dot skirt on. I also went to Kenzie's school to help out with her class holiday party. I brought two games for the class to play. Then I also played "Ella the Elf" for her class where she left treats and snow everywhere in the class.</p>

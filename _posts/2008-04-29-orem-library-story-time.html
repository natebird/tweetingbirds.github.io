				On Wednesday of last week, I went to the Orem Library with my friends, Julia and her son, Hayden, and Kelly and her daughter, Victoria. We went to the story time that morning where the story time lady read stories about animals riding bicycles. It was so much fun to see them because the last time we saw Julia was April two years ago when Hayden was about 6 months old and I was pregnant with Kenzie. The last time we saw Kelly and Victoria was November 2006. The kids had a great time at the library, mostly running around the children's section and jumping on the benches.</p>
<p>While we were at the library, I ran into a friend of mine from my BYU singles ward, Kim. She works at the Orem Library. Julia also knew her since we were all in the same ward. It was fun to catch up a little bit.</p>

				I am personally proud of my awesome purchases when I am able to save lots and lots of money. But Nate told me I should post it on my blog and share my secrets. Anyone with children knows how expensive it can be with diapers, food, clothing, and all sorts of baby accessories. So when I go out shopping, I try to buy more but spend less. When I do, I come home with a huge smile on my face and excitedly hands over my receipts for Nate to see all the money I saved with sales and coupons. Nate calls it my job. Since I don't have an actual job, Nate says that I have turned saving money into a career.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><br /></span><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">My advantage?</span> Time. I don't have to have anything right now. I am willing to wait for things to go on sale and then purchase it with coupons.</p>
<p>This is my way of contributing to our family finances since I don't bring in a paycheck every month. I am careful about where all of Nate's hard earned money goes.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">The secret:</span> Wait for things to go on sale. And sometimes it's not a very good sale, so you have to be patient and wait for a better sale, 50% off or more. Then use coupons. The trick with coupons is have both store coupons and manufacture coupons so you can double up on the coupons per one item.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">My latest awesome buys:</span> I got 8 fleece one piece and two pieces <a href="http://www.kohls.com/kohlsStore/clearance/kids1/toddlergirls/PRD~244343/Carters+Bunny+Diamond+Footed+Pajamas.jsp"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Carter's pajamas</span></span></a> for Kenzie (sizes 2T-4T for her to grow into) for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">$4 each</span></span> (that's the price including shipping and handling) on Kohls.com, regular price $20-$25 each.</p>
<p>Went to BJs (similar to Costco or Sam's Club) the other day with my mom and I was able to get the new <a href="http://www.glade.com/en-US/Products/Pages/GladeCandles.aspx"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">Glade Wisp Flameless Candles</span></span></a> with 3 refills for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">$3.50 each</span></span>... regular price $19 each. So I bought two boxes. I used three different coupons. I love the flameless candle because it's like a candle, but uses batteries. It also illuminates in the jar making it look like flickering flames. So much safer with a toddler around.</p>
<p>Ever since Christmas, I have been eyeing the <a href="http://www.dirtdevil.com/Products/productDetail.aspx?id=39981"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 0, 102);">Dirt Devil Kone</span></span></a>. I have been looking for some kind of handheld vacuum to help pick up spills of flour or food in the kitchen, snacks on the couch, crushed cereals in the carpet, dropped food under the high chair, and cleaning the interior of our car. I saw the Kones at Wal-Mart and Target for $40, but I didn't get it because I thought that was a bit expensive for my needs. Then I was at Big Lots two weeks ago with a 20% off coupon my whole purchase. I saw one last Kone left, a white one, on clearance for $25. I got it for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">$20</span></span> (50% off Wal-Mart's price) with my coupon! And I love the Kone! It has been so useful with keeping a clean house... only a clean, orderly freak like me can call the Kone my new best friend.</p>
<p>Thanks to my friend, Tannen, she told me about a huge sale and gave me coupons for apple juice and applesauce at Publix, it's a grocery store like Albertsons. I was able to buy a six pack (individual cups) of Mott's applesauce for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">46 cents each pack</span></span>... regularly $2.89. Kenzie loves the applesauce and it also comes in different fruits such as peaches, green apple, strawberries, and blueberries. It's all natural with no sugar added. And then I got 64 fl oz Mott's apple juice for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">44 cents each</span></span>. The juice is also all natural with no sugar added (a big deal for me who watches for the high fructose corn syrups in ingredients).</p>
<p>I bought everything in the picture for <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">$11.71</span></span> at Publix on Monday. My total savings: $40.78!!! There is 12 jugs of juice, 6 packs of applesauce, and 2 boxes of cake mix.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Cp0QScTgI/AAAAAAAABRI/gcVG9uKtZJw/s1600-h/IMG_7325.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7325.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165815487784570370" /></a></p>
<p>I also purchased from The Children's Place online a pair of black mary jane black dress shoes <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">($5.52)</span></span>, a pair of pink and white sneakers <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">($7.22)</span></span>, a pair of jeans <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">($6.79)</span></span>, two pairs of socks <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">($0.42 each)</span></span> and a nice long sleeve shirt <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">($2.97)</span></span> for Kenzie- total cost including shipping and handling... <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">$30.02</span></span>. If I bought it regular price at The Children's Place, a brand name for children's clothing, it would have been over $65 for all of that.<a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Cz0gScTmI/AAAAAAAABR4/JS7b-z8cboc/s1600-h/050758_m.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/050758_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165826487195815522" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Cz0wScTnI/AAAAAAAABSA/8JneaQtDQyY/s1600-h/047945_m.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/047945_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165826491490782834" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Cz1QScToI/AAAAAAAABSI/FDNpB7_9QsY/s1600-h/689226_m.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/689226_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165826500080717442" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Cz1gScTpI/AAAAAAAABSQ/8VJTBvje6aA/s1600-h/815722_m.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/815722_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165826504375684754" /></a><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R7Cz1wScTqI/AAAAAAAABSY/F8w0Utb6VWk/s1600-h/031089_m.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/031089_m.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5165826508670652066" /></a><br />Those of you without kids, you are probably wondering how anyone can pay so much for children's clothes and shoes... I agree, I think children's clothes and shoes are way over priced and they grow out of them so fast! You can't find decent children's shoes for less than $15 anywhere. And children's clothes are as much as adult's clothes, even with much less material. Luckily, Kenzie haven't grown much the last few months. So she still fits in 18 months clothes.		</p>

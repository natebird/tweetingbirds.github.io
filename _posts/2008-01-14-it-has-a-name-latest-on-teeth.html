				Kenzie started to call her favorite blanket Night Night last week. She came up with the name herself. I guess since that's what she has to have when she goes to sleep, the name is quite fitting. Also, just today, she started to go to bed with her little Hello Kitty that she got for Christmas from her Puo Puo (my mom). She's at that age where she needs the comfort.</p>
<p>On a side note, we are now all suffering from a cold. Once again, it began with Kenzie, then passed on to me and finally Nate. I also think Kenzie is teething since she is whinny, moody, and slobbery from drool. She constantly sticks her fingers or anything chewable in her mouth. And she has a runny nose for the past few days. I felt in the very back of her mouth, I could feel a couple molars under her gums, but nothing has popped out yet. Her mouth already contains 16 teeth. Yup, by 16 months she had 16 teeth. She started early with the first tooth cutting through at 3 1/2 months! That took all of us by surprise.</p>
<p>We started her on brushing teeth with toddler toothpaste (doesn't have fluoride and can be swallowed). She loves it! We have been brushing her teeth with just a toothbrush and water. But now we added toothpaste and it's a big hit. I think she actually sucks off the bubble gum flavored toothpaste before it even gets to her teeth. Now she won't brush her teeth without toothpaste on the brush.		</p>

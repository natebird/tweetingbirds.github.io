				Wednesday night, the evening before our trip, Nate came home sick with a fever and achy gums in his mouth. He went straight to bed. I kept myself busy by taking care of a sick Kenzie who had bronchitis and an ear infection, packing for both Kenzie and me, and cleaning the house. I do not like coming home to a dirty house. So I mopped and swept the floors, cleaned the kitchen, did the dishes, and cleaned our refrigerator. I never got around to vacuuming, I chose sleep instead. Nate finally woke up around 9 p.m. to pack his bags and went back to sleep. That was his second day fighting a fever that broke a few times but kept coming back.</p>
<p>Thursday, 5:30 a.m., we woke up gathering the last of our things and moved the luggage downstairs. My aunt, Stacey, came over to drive us to the airport. It just so happened that she is a nurse and she diagnosed Nate's symptoms as an oral virus that caused canker sores, cold sores, fevers, and gums to turn purple and swollen. With a diagnosis, she said Nate would need a prescription to help destroy the virus. Since it was 6:45 a.m. and on our way to the airport, we didn't have time for a doctor appointment. Nate didn't want to end up going to some holistic doctor in Taiwan either.</p>
<p>Luckily, our family doctor is a friend of ours in my parents' ward. So we called him home to find out he was already at his office. We called the office to find the lines not opened yet because it was before office hours. Nate called his home again to get the doctor's cell phone. He answered and quickly called in a prescription for Nate after we explained the situation and apologized for calling him on his cell phone. We are so grateful for him because the trip would have been a disaster without that prescription.</p>
<p>The doctor called the prescription to the only pharmacy he knew that was opened at that time. We had already passed the place of the pharmacy and didn't have time to turn around to pick it up. My parents had just left for the airport, so we got a hold of them to ask them to pick up the prescription for Nate. Since Nate had never been to that particular pharmacy, I called the pharmacy to give them his information and our insurance information over the phone. They had the prescription ready by the time my parents got to the pharmacy, but they couldn't run it through our insurance - turned out they added an extra 0 in our insurance ID number. We went ahead and paid for the full price of the prescription, $200.09, since it was an emergency.</p>
<p>We all made it to the airport on time and safely. As we checked in our luggage, one of our suitcase that contained only the pack 'n play and some diapers measured too big. Delta was going to charge us $150 for the luggage. We told the lady it wasn't worth it because it didn't really have much in it. She decided to let it go, but warned us that if we were going to bring it back, we would have to pay extra for it. Needless to say, we didn't bring that luggage back.</p>
<p>Thus began the 20 hour flight to Taipei. The flight to LAX (Los Angeles) wasn't too bad. Kenzie was an infant in lap because she is less than 24 months and it would have cost an additional $600 for her own seat. It was nice to have my parents on the same flights there so they could help out with taking care of Kenzie and keeping her entertained.</p>

It went through, but then we had to figure out how to receive our refund since my mom put it on her credit card and we won't have her credit card when we get back to do the refund. I also didn't appreciate LAX making us get out of the airport, walk quite the stretch, and back into some under ground hole for our international flight with all our carry-on luggage (Nate's laptop bag, my backpack, Kenzie's backpack, the car seat, and the diaper bag).</p>

Nate was still sick on our travel there and had the fever twice. I took care of the sick, but high spirited, Kenzie most of the time, keeping the two ill people away from each other so they didn't cross contaminate each other. I held Kenzie for about 8 hours as she slept in my arms. I definitely felt it the next day. We requested a bassinet for Kenzie, she was the right weight, but a bit long. The stewardess kept walking by concerned about Kenzie as she looked cramped in the bassinet. But as Kenzie's mom, I knew that Kenzie often slept with her legs tucked in. In the end, I held her in my arms so people would quit bothering me about it while I tried to sleep.</p>

<p>Every Christmas for the last 3 years (with the exception of last Christmas, and I don't know why) we made gingerbread houses with my family. This year we did it without my brother Jeffrey who is on a mission in Ogden, Utah. He is usually the one who builds a mansion complete with a full floor plan with rooms, several levels, and doors that open and close.

<div>This year Nate tried to beat Jeffrey's record, taking an advantage of the fact that Jeffery wasn't here to defend his title. Nate built the tallest gingerbread house. It is also a contest to see who can build the coolest house, although a winner is never declared. </div>

<div>This year I went for a more untraditional gingerbread house and built a pool instead. Kenzie wanted to participate by eating all the candy. She has never had that much sugar... ever! And she didn't go to bed until 11 p.m. just having fun running around and playing. But she did sleep in until 10:30 the next morning. </div>

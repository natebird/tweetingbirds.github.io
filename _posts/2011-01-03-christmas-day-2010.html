<p>This is going to be a long post. We had such a great Christmas this year. We awoke to the tree filled with gifts and stocking stuffed with surprises from Santa. The girls slept in that morning until about 8, which meant I got to sleep in too. Yay!</p>
<p>Christmas morning, the girls coming downstairsâ€¦</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2733" title="IMG_2483 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2483.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>Then their cute little faces discovering presents under the tree. I love capturing their expressions.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2734" title="IMG_2493 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2493.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2735" title="IMG_2495 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2495.jpg" alt="" width="387" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2736" title="IMG_2505 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2505.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>First checking out the presents. Then seeing the stockings stuffed.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2737" title="IMG_2512 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2512.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Then discovering that Santa came by and ate their cookies. Leaving some crumbs.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2738" title="IMG_2524 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2524.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="385" /></p>
<p>Their stockings were filled with princess necklaces and bracelets, hair bands and electric toothbrush with toothpaste.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2739" title="IMG_2549 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2549.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>I opened my gifts from Nate. He got me Polaroid film for my collection of cameras. Awesome! And he got me new cases for my iPhone and a screen protector. He's so thoughtful. I got a few other things too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2740" title="IMG_2560 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2560.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Laney opened up the Beauty and the Beast DVD, a Bell tea cart, dress up clothes, regular clothes and such. I made both girls pajamas this year, too.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2741" title="IMG_2569 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2569.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2745" title="IMG_2621 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2621.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>I also found them super cute Hello Kitty slippers.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2744" title="IMG_2614 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2614.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>Kenzie got the Repunzel dress for dress up. And this year she asked Santa for Toy Story 3 DVD and a checker board.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2742" title="IMG_2576 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2576.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2746" title="IMG_2668 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2668.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>Nate wanted the Michael Jackson dance game for the Wii. And if you know Nate, it would be a surprise to you that that's what he wanted. I also got him Ticket to Ride Europe and another game. We're big gaming people. We have a collection of games. So next time you want to play, let us know.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2743" title="IMG_2588 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2588.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2748" title="IMG_2699 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2699.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>I also made Nate and Kenzie chunky pocket scarves. Super warm. We'll need it when we go snow tubing.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2749" title="IMG_2706 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2706.jpg" alt="" width="340" height="550" /></p>
<p>Grandma and Grandpa Bird sent the girls a collection of Scripture Scouts. Now they can learn about the scriptures and Articles of Faith in the car. Oh fun.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2747" title="IMG_2692 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2692.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="550" /></p>
<p>The chaos after opening the presents.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2750" title="IMG_2719 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2719.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Then one of Nate's co-workers didn't have anything going on for Christmas, so we invited him over to spend the day with us. He came for breakfast and we had a little gift for him. I made him a skinny scarf and gave him some imported goodies. Darshan is from India and doesn't have any family or friends in Georgia. He said that for the 2 1/2 years he has been in Georgia, he has never been invited to anyone's home before. He was a pleasure to have in our home. The girls loved playing with him.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2751" title="IMG_2735 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2735.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>Then the plan was to go over to my grandparents' house for family festivities. But the snow started to come down around 11 a.m. Phone call went back and forth about whether we should still get together or not. Finally, it was decided to cancel it. Well, we decided to go anyway and spend Christmas with Grandma and Grandpa, especially since Grandma made a 20 lb. turkey that no one will eat. So we headed over there and the roads weren't bad. My parents were there with my grandparents and it was nice to have a little quiet Christmas with them. Darshan came along and he enjoyed the company.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2752" title="IMG_2754 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2754.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>The drive home the road was covered in snow. But it still wasn't too bad. No ice. We made it home just fine. We didn't have any trouble until we got into our neighborhood and trying to get into the garage in our driveway. Luckily, I have a husband who is an expert when it comes to driving in the snow, since he grew up in it. He had to get some traction to get into our driveway (picture below).</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2753" title="IMG_2759 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2759.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Our neighborhood Christmas night. And church was cancelled the next day. It was awesome. We got to spend another full day together.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2754" title="IMG_2766 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2766.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2755" title="IMG_2768 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2768.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" />		</p>

				"Heavenly Father,
<div></div>
<div>Bless the sun and moon.</div>
<div>Bless our house.</div>
<div>Thank you for swimming. </div>
<div>Bless the movies.</div>
<div>Bless Curious George.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Jesus Christ,</div>
<div>Amen!"</div>
<div></div>
<div>Kenzie said that for our family prayer tonight. I broke down and laughed out loud when she said Curious George.</div>

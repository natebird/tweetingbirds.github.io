<p>I am down to weekly OB appointments. Oh boy. That means the baby is coming soon. I can't believe how fast this pregnancy has been. It has helped that we have been so busy these past nine months. But now I am dying in this summer heat and humidity. Why did I have another baby in August? It was rough the first time. And this time she's arriving at the end of August. Yikes.</p>
<p>So, baby newsâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li>I am 37 weeks with only 3 more to go. Wow. That's soon.</li>
<li>She is head down and has been for the past couple of months.</li>
<li>I am dilated to 1 cm. No biggie because this has happened with my past two pregnancies. I started dilating a month prior to delivery. With Kenzie I was dilated to 4 1/2 cm by the time I went to the hospital. And with lane I was dilated to 3 cm when I went into the hospital. So we'll see how far I go with this one.</li>
<li>We still don't have a name. We do have a few names in mind but nothing finalized. I think this time around I want to meet her first before deciding on the name.</li>
<li>I have gained 28 pounds. I always put on the pounds at the end of my pregnancy. I do hope I don't go over 35 pounds this last month. I hope I don't swell too much in this heat and humidity. Aaahhh!</li>
<li>I am running out of motivation to do stuff. I just want to spend time with the family and do things I want to do before this baby comes and rocks our world.</li>
<li>She is an active baby, always kicking, having hiccups and moving around.</li>
<li>Technically I don't have gestational diabetes this time around so they will let me go past my due date of August 29th only by a week if I don't go into labor naturally. The other two girls came a few days early so I am banking on that.</li>
</ul>

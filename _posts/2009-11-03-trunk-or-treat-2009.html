<div style="text-align: left;">I flew solo for our ward trunk-or-treat because Nate got sick and had to stay home and watch college football alone on the couch. Luckily, my dad came with us and was able to help out with the kids. I didn't even hand out candy to the kids because I was busy taking my kids around. I also had to help out with the YW's face painting activity for the primary kids. Thanks, Bobi, for taking this picture of us. I had my camera, but it never left the case.</div>

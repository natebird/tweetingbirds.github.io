				More pictures from Magic Kingdom. This is Kenzie getting off the roller coaster ride. I was so surprised that she wanted to go on a roller coaster. But she went on Goofy's Barnride, or Nate calls it the world's shortest roller coaster ride. She went on it twice. First time with me and a second time with Nate. Both times she had both hands up. What a dare devil. This is a picture of her getting off the ride.</p>

<p>While Kenzie was on the roller coaster ride, Laney played at the playground at Toontown. It was nice for her to get out and run around.</p>

<p>The Swiss Family Robinson Home. Awesome. it was a dream come true for me. When I was little, I loved the movie Swiss Family Robinson. I always wanted to live in their treehouse.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2299" title="IMG_0656 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0656.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /><br />
<img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2300" title="IMG_0657 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0657.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Then Laney tried to jump into Cinderella's fountain.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2301" title="IMG_0663 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0663.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>And Laney was having a great time swinging on the waiting lines. Of course she wasn't supposed to do that.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2302" title="IMG_9633 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9633.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></p>
<p>We also rode on the train. It was a relaxing ride.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2303" title="IMG_9729 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_9729.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></p>
<p>Then we stayed late at the parks only one of the nights we were there because usually around 7 p.m., our kids were exhausted. But Magic Kingdom was cool at night too. The Electrical Parade was pretty cool. We watched the parade then headed back on the ferry while the fire works went off. The kids were way too tired. Couldn't last through the fireworks. So we watched it on the way to the parking lot. It was actually pretty awesome to watch it over water. The reflection made it look bigger.</p>

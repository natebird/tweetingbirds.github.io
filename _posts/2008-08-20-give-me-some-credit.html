				I have began my journey as a single mom this week as Nate started school three nights a week. Today, after Kenzie's nap, I could smell a strong stench meaning a nasty diaper. After changing a huge nasty diaper, Kenzie and I had the following conversation about her favorite Disney movie, The Little Mermaid, also my favorite.
<div></div>
<div>Kenzie: Mermaid is nice. Flounder and Sebastian are nice. </div>
<div>Me: What about mommy? Is mommy nice?</div>
<div>Kenzie: No. Ariel is nice.</div>
<div>Me: What?! Mommy is not nice?! What about daddy? Is daddy nice?</div>
<div>Kenzie: Yes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>End of Conversation. </div>

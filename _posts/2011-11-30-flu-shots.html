<p>We are all up on our flu shots this year. Nate and I included. Our insurance paid for it so I thought we should probably take advantage of that and get the flu shot this year. In a way it protects Lai LaiÂ since she is not old enough to get the shot. And with Kenzie in school and both Kenzie and Laney in primary classes, it's just safer to protect us from the flu. I had mastitis twice this year. That comes with flu like symptoms and I do not want to go through that again with the actual flu.</p>
<p>The girls had to get booster shots because they didn't get the shot last year. Taking them to get their booster shot they knew what was coming and started crying before they even got the shot. So they were rewarded with a lollipop and sticker after the shot. It's the only time I would give them a lollipop at 10:11 a.m.		</p>

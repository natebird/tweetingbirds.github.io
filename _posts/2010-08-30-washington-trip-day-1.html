<p style="text-align: left;">It has been four years since we were last in Washington visiting Nate's family. The last time we were there was December 2006 when Kenzie was 4 months old. We just never got a chance to go back since then with the cost of flight tickets and Nate in school for two whole years. Two weeks after he finished school, we spent 8 days in Washington. It just worked out that four of Nate's siblings were able to be home at the same time. So Nate's parents had 5 of 8 kids plus their only two grandchildren back in their home for the week. They were in heaven.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1612" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/08/washington-trip-day-1/img_5051/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1612" title="IMG_5051 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5051.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We left on a Monday morning. My mom came super early and took us to the airport. We had no problem getting through the airport in Atlanta. We managed to pack <strong>all</strong> of our stuff into 3 carry-on luggages, my camera bag that also worked as the diaper bag, Nate's laptop bag, an adult size backpack and two children size backpacks. Nate and I had a system going where luggages and bags were attached to each other. We had one bag on our backs and/or shoulder, one hand towing luggage and one hand holding the hand of one of our girls. It's going to get tricky when we have another kid.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Luckily we had a direct flight to Seattle and arrived in about 5 hours. With all our luggages with us, we didn't have to wait for anything. It was awesome. Laney took a nap on the plane while Kenzie spent the most of the flight watching movies on Nate's iPad. Upon arrival in Seattle around noon, Nate's cousin Jared came to pick us up. Jared and his wife and kids live in Renton, about 15 minutes away from the airport. We spent the remainder of Monday with Jared's family and spent a night with them. It was so fun to catch up with Jared and his family. They have two girls around the same age as Kenzie and Laney. Kenzie had a great time playing with her cousins, but Laney… Well, let's just say there was some rivalry there.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Everyone kept saying how hot it was in Washington. Yeah, 90+ degrees is hot, but at least it wasn't high humidity like we were used to in the South. So it actually felt great to us. I was just shocked that no one in Seattle had AC in their homes! They said it's never hot enough there to own one except for maybe one week of the year. But if you were out in the shade outside, it was just perfect.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1614" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/08/washington-trip-day-1/img_5084/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1614" title="IMG_5084 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5084.jpg" alt="" width="367" height="550" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We played in their yard for a bit, had lunch, then went to a beach park about 15 minutes away from their house. This park was so amazing. Great views, a shallow beach for people to swim with lifeguards, playgrounds for the children, restaurants nearby, Wi-Fi and picnic tables with grills. The girls had a great time chasing the ducks and dipping their feet in the water. It was quite refreshing.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a rel="attachment wp-att-1615" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/08/washington-trip-day-1/img_5094/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1615" title="IMG_5094 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5094.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="392" /></a></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">That night the kids went to sleep pretty good. But Laney awoke at 2 a.m. and realized she was somewhere unknown. So we stuck her in the bed with us and she went back to sleep. That means I didn't sleep well because I can't sleep with kids in bed with us. They never sleep with us on our bed. Then around 6 a.m. both kids were ready to go… Of course, because it was 9 a.m. EST.</p>

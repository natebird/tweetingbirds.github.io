				Is it bad that…
<ul>
<li>Kenzie told me the other day that Puo Puo (my mom) wrapped her birthday gift in teddy bear wrapping paper? Her birthday was 3 months ago.</li>
<li>I only save my legs once a month? There are times it's longer than that. The hairs on my legs doesn't grow much. Nate says he doesn't even notice when I don't save. I do, I'm just lazy.</li>
<li>I've been wanting to purchase a $30 book but wouldn't purchase it until I found a way to get it for only $3? I'm way too cheap.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Laney is so close to walking and she's only 9 months old today? She is growing up much too fast for my taste.</li>
<li>I've been losing weight without exercising? So now I think I can eat whatever I want and not have to exercise.</li>
<li>Everything I do I try to find a way to turn it into a post for my blogs?</li>
<li>I make Laney wear clothes that are too small for her because I'm too lazy to do laundry?</li>
<li>I throw my sick kid in front of the TV so I can get stuff done? The rule at our house is 1 movie a day… unless you are sick, then it's unlimited.</li>
<li>I rarely watch TV, maybe 1-2 hours a week? And when I do, I have to be doing something while watching. I just can't sit and watch.</li>
</ul>

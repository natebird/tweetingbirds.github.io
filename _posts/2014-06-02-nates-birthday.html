				It was a busy day for all of us. Kenzie had her dance competition. And then I planned a surprise for Nate. I ordered his gift then had him pick it up at the store. I texted him the order number and he walked into the Apple store by himself and picked up his gift that he didn't know what it was. I got him the Sphero 2.0, it's a ball robot. It's pretty cool robot. Lai Lai loves it and has taken it as her own. It hangs out in her room now. And then we picked up an ice cream cake from Cold Stone. I also surprised him with a Despicable Me cake. It was a fun day. </p>

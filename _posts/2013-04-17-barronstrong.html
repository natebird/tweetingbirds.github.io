<p>
				Irene was doing the Spartan race. Barron and my dad were going to do it with her. They both bailed out on her. My dad did a trail run race instead on the same day. Irene was a bit bummed that the people she was going to do it with didn't end up doing it with her. So I made her a shirt that said BarronSTRONG on the front and "Just Flying My Colors" on the back. It was a simple black shirt with white writing on a woman's fitted V-neck shirt. I actually made two. One for Irene and one for me. I gave it to her when we were going down to Atlanta for a Matchstic meeting and stake temple night one Thursday evening. It was a surprise. She didn't know I was making the shirt for her. I actually I did it all last minute. She loved the shirt and it was great for her to have that with her on her race. She has been wearing it several times since then. I'm glad she loved the shirt. It was a simple thing that I thought could help her through the race. </p>
<p>Since then, I gave the shirt I made for myself to Camille because she ended up doing the Spartan with Irene and she wanted to wear that shirt. We didn't have enough time to make her a shirt in time for the race so I just gave her mine. Then Nate, my dad, Cody, Ty wanted one too. So I made a second batch for them with a second shirt for me. Then Kelsey, Laney and Kenzie and Elder Cowley who used to serve in GA on his mission and worked with Barron when he was the ward mission leader wanted one too. So I made a third batch for them. I ended up making 11 shirts. More people had expressed they wanted a shirt, but I just don't have the time to make more Barron shirts. I might take it to a press to see how much for them to make the shirts. But I'm not going to worry about that for a while. I have other things I need to work on first. </p>
<p>I am just so glad that my Silhouette machine cuts out the stencil so I don't have to use an exacto knife any more. Saved me so much time!</p>

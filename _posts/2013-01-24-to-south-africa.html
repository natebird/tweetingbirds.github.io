<p>Nate has a friend he made from his MBA program name Peter. They actually met at orientation dinner before the program even started. I was there and remember meeting him too. The two of them became good friends during the program taking classes together and such. At the time, Peter was married with no kids. We started doing dinners with them at each other's homes. They lived by Six Flags. Throughout the years, we would meet up every once in a while and saw them through their attempts to get pregnant, her rough pregnancy, and the miracle of their baby Amy. We've talked about them before on our blog. Anyway, they decided to move back to South Africa where Kat (the wife) is from. Peter is from Uganda. They traveled quite a bit for leisure and for business. They also went back to South Africa often too. They wanted to be close to family who were all in Africa still. It was sad but also fun to watch as they make that transition. We had them over for dinner before they left the country and they even came over on Halloween and trick-or-treated with our girls. We hope to visit them in South Africa someday. They said it is an amazing place, really beautiful and right on the beach in Cape Cod. 		</p>

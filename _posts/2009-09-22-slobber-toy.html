				It has been a struggle teaching Kenzie to share her toys with Laney. She is very possessive of her stuff. And she has been in more timeouts lately than ever before for hitting or pushing Laney. I understand some of her toys should be off limits to Laney because they are <i>hers</i> (i.e. Disney princesses, her doll house with little pieces). I've been trying to tell Kenzie that she needs to give different toys to occupy and distract Laney from the off limits toys. But also making sure that Kenzie doesn't always get her way so she doesn't turn into a brat one day.</p>
<p>I arrived at this scene.</p>
<p><i>Laney kept grabbing at Mulan and a necklace dangling from the doll house.</i><br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>Kenzie:</b> [screaming] No! No, Laney!<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> Kenzie, please don't yell at Laney.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> But she keeps ruining my stuff. She is going to slobber on it.<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> You need to share your toys with Laney.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> I don't want her to eat my toys.<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> Are you going to share the necklace or princess Mulan with Laney?<br /><i>Kenzie looks at the Mulan and the necklace in her hands. Then she looks around the room and grabs a burp cloth.</i><br /><b>Kenzie:</b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, she can play with this. [Hands burp cloth to Laney] She can slobber on that toy.		</p>

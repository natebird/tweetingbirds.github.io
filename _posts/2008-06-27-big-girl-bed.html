				I finally finished Kenzie's bed and we put it together Wednesday night. Kenzie was pretty psyched about switching to a big girl bed. She was there with all the tools to take down her crib and put together her big girl bed. She slept in the bed just fine the past couple nights. She only fell off once, but we had our down comforter at the bottom of her bed to catch her. She is still figuring out how to craw up and down the bed. She's adjusting to not having bars to restrict her. I'm just glad that is over with and she is sleeping just fine in it. Yesterday, at exactly 2 p.m., her nap time, she headed up the stairs and said, "Nap time!"</p>
<p>I have put off potty training the last few days because I didn't want her to stress with that and switching to a toddler bed all at the same time. But we'll pick up on the potty training here soon. I'm waiting for a weekend when Nate can help me. But considering how the next few weekends we have plans or visitors, it may be a while before we jump back on the potty training wagon.</p>

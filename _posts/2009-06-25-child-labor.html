<p>
				I have been making Kenzie clean up her toys and mess each night before her bedtime routine. She has been doing pretty well without complaining, untilâ€¦
<div></div>
<div>Kenzie: Mom, why do we have to clean up?</div>
<div>Tiffany: Because that's how we keep our house nice and clean.</div>
<div>Kenzie: I like our house to be nice and clean.</div>
<div>Tiffany: Me, too.</div>
<div>Kenzie: But I don't like to clean up my mess because it's hard work.</div>

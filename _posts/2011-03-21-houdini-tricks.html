				Little Houdini returns. I've talked about how our little Laney is nicknamed Little Houdini because she can get out of anything - example <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/11/houdini/" target="_blank">here</a> and <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/breaks-my-heart/" target="_blank">here</a>. Lately she has been trying to get out of her car seat while we are driving. She sits there frustrated yelling, "I'm stuck!" Last week she's been getting her arms out even though the straps are not loose. She just pushes the top buckle down far enough to squeeze her arm through. This child… She's going to send me to jail one day. Sorry about the bad pictures. I had to use my phone because that's what I had at the time and it was really late at night in the car.</p>

<p>
				Last week was a <em>crazy</em> week to say the least. Nate had left on Sunday for a business trip. He went to Austin, Texas, for a Ruby on Rails conference with his coworker Shawn. We went to sacrament meeting in our ward then left afterwards to take Nate to the airport. On the way back form the airport we went to my parents' ward for primary and Relief Society. Then over to their house to hang out and dinner. The girls love going over to Puo Puo and Dudepa's house.</p>
<p>That night the girls were so tired, they fell asleep in the car. I put them in their beds and they were good to go. When Lai Lai woke up at 3:50 a.m. to nurse, I noticed the smell of gas in the house. It was upstairs and I could smell it in Lai Lai's room too. I was pretty sure it was coming from the vents as the heater kicked on with temperatures in the 30-40 degrees that night. It was a light gas smell so I decided it could probably wait until the morning. I went back to sleep. Laney woke up at 5 a.m. to go potty. At that time, I still smelled gas. So I decided to Google it to find out how serious of a problem it was. Everything I read said for me to call the gas or heating and AC company as soon as possible because the smell of gas was pretty serious.</p>
<p>I called the gas company's 24-hour hotline. The lady on the phone made it sound like an emergency. She told me to get out of the house immediately. Don't turn on anything electric, don't use my cell phone, don't turn on any switches. Any of those things may ignite something and blow up the house. She told me not to go back in the house until the technician showed up to investigate the source of the gas leak.</p>
<p>I got myself dressed because it was pretty cold outside. Then I grabbed some blankets and jackets for the girls then got them up. We started to head outside but it was way too windy and cold. They were all crying that it was too windy and cold. So we headed back inside the house and I decided to back the van out onto the driveway and have the girls wait in there. It was going to take the technician 30 minutes to an hour to get to our house. I wasn't going to have the girls stand out in the cold for that long. We would all be sick. Plus I couldn't smell any gas downstairs. I also grabbed some snacks and drinks for the girls because they were all hungry. It was 6 a.m. around the time I would be getting up to get ready for the day.</p>
<p>The technician showed up and he told me we didn't really have to wait outside for him. He said the lady on the phone was just doing protocol. But if the house were to explode, sitting in the driveway wouldn't have helped anyway. Which is funny because the lady told me I needed to be by the house so I could wave down the technician when he came by. We all got back in the house and the girls hung out downstairs while he checked the furnace and such upstairs and in the attic.</p>
<p>It turned out I was right. There was gas coming from the vents. It was a low amount. It was caused by one of the burners in the furnace burning improperly. He gave me a card to a guy he recommended for heating and air. He turned the gas off because it was enough of a problem for it to be a concern. Kenzie was a little late for school but she said he was excited to tell her friends that she was late because there was gas in our house.</p>
<p>After dropping Kenzie off at school, Lai Lai decided to have an explosive diaper. It got poop everywhere, including the carpets. The onesie she wore was thrown away. No way that could have been salvaged. And a few hours later Laney was crying and thawing a tantrum. I called around to find a decent heating and air guy. Ended up going with the guy the technician recommended. He came later that afternoon to check it out.</p>

<p>The heating guy thought the furnace just needed to be cleaned. But that didn't work. So he tried something else and then large flames blew out of the furnace. He declared the furnace to be unsafe and told us we needed to get a new one. Of course the warranty on the france expired last October. Alright then, there goes all our birthday monies! I called Nate in Texas and said, "Happy birthday! You get a furnace!" He was excited. He said he had always wanted to get a furnace for his birthday. *sarcastically*. The heating guy said he would be back Tuesday to install the new furnace.</p>
<p>Monday night was also cold. So I turned the heat on downstairs to about 74 degrees so the heat could travel upstairs to keep us warm that night. I also pulled out winter pajamas again and got out extra blankets. We had put away all the winter stuff because it was 80 degrees just a few days ago. This year it has been really weird hot cold weather.</p>
<p>Tuesday the heating guy came back with the new furnace. He installed it that afternoon. We used it that night and then turned it off the next day. The AC came on by Thursday. Crazy weather, I tell you. Wednesday I started to feel sick. Couldn't tell if it was a cold or allergies - runny nose, watery eyes, sneezing, sore throat, congestion. Yucky. I took a Claritin to keep me going. We picked up Nate from the airport Wednesday night.</p>
<p>My birthday was on Thursday, which I was still sick. But still had a fun day shopping with my mom and the girls. Then we went out to lunch. That evening we went out for dinner, just Nate and the girls. Nate got me a really yummy ice cream cake from Cold Stone.</p>
<p>Friday, still sick. But at least I didn't have to take a Claritin to function that day. It was mostly congestion. At least there's the weekend to recover.		</p>

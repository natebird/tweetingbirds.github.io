				Yes, I can't really complain about my situation since many of you have been or is currently in similar situations. Or, others may have even worst situations. So there's no complaining coming from me.</p>
<p>It has been an adjustment for all three of us getting used to not having Nate around as much. Kenzie misses her daddy a whole lot. She even begged to go to work with him yesterday. I try to keep myself busy so I don't sit there counting the hours. Nate is much too busy with all he has to do to even ponder how much he is gone.</p>
<p>Hopefully we only have two more years of this!		</p>

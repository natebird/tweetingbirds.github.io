<p>This girl is a trip. Laney is a whole new personality to deal with.</p>
<ul>
<li>She is my polite kid. She is always thanking me for doing things for her or helping her.</li>
<li>She has been challenging authority. "No" has been her favorite word.</li>
<li>She always thinks outside of the box. Unconventional ways of eating and doing things. I have no idea where she gets these creative ideas on how to do things.</li>
<li>She weighed 30 pounds and 37" tall at her 3-year wellness check.</li>
<li>I love being home with her during the day. She is so fun to hang with.</li>
<li>She loves to dress up and accessorize.</li>
<li>She has to wear a skirt every day. Even over pants and jeans.</li>
<li>Her favorite color is pink and nothing else. Everything has to be pink for her - clothes, accessories, shoes, cups, plates, food, etc.</li>
<li>She is very good a figuring out how to do things, get into stuff and take stuff apart.</li>
<li>She has a natural ability to be good at physical things, like dance and sports.</li>
<li>Is potty trained even through the night. But every once in a while she has an accident or wets her bed. But that's very seldom. She wakes up when she needs to go in the middle of the night but she's just lazy and doesn't get up to go.</li>
<li>Likes to watch movies and act out scenes of it, especially princess movies or parts that have dancing in it.</li>
<li>Still loves shoes. She is always in my closet going through my shoes and tromping around the house wearing them.</li>
<li>Her pronunciation is getting much better. I can understand more of what she is saying.</li>
<li>I love that she is spunky and has lots of little quirks.</li>
<li>She loves it when daddy comes home. She runs out to the garage when she hears him pull in.</li>
<li>She's still in nursery for another year since her birthday is at the end of January. But she loves nursery, so that's good.</li>
<li>She likes to push Kenzie's buttons. She knows exactly how to annoy her sister.</li>
<li>She loves Lai Lai. She is always helping her, sitting with her, singing to her and playing with her. She loves to get Lai LaiÂ after a nap and just get in the crib with her.</li>
</ul>

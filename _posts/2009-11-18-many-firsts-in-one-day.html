<p>Don't even say it. It's obvious she's a little funny looking now because I cut her bangs last week. I had to because her baby hair was uneven and getting in her eyes. So to even it out, I had to give her short bangs and make her look like Lloyd from <i>Dumb and Dumber</i>. Poor kid. I had to do the same with Kenzie around the same age and it took forever for it to grow it out.</p>
<p>As mentioned before, this little girl walked 3 steps last Monday. Now she is at about 5-10 steps. And when we hold her hands to assist her in walking, she doesn't walk. She runs. I have a feeling this one will keep me active.</p>
<p>Yesterday, she had a few firsts… <i>first time drinking from a straw</i>. I tell you, CapriSuns or juice boxes are the way to go in teaching a baby how to drink from a straw. I only had to squeeze the juice box once to get the juice going and she picked it right up.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<i>First time eating soap</i>. Laney was going through the unused bottles of baby shampoos and body wash while I helped Kenzie on the potty. I turn around to find Laney with one of the tops unscrewed and she has body wash all over her pajamas and hand. And she's trying to lick the dispenser tube that is covered with soap. She was trying to lick the soap off her hands as I was trying to wash it off her.</p>
<p><i>First time getting her finger smashed by the door</i>. Kenzie was trying to close the bathroom door to prevent Laney from going in and playing in the toilet. Laney had her hand at the hinge opening.</p>
<p><i>First time eating cheese</i>. If she is going to be a part of this family, she will have to LOVE cheese. She took it well today.</p>

<p>She has also taken up cooking. She loves to cook in her sister's kitchen. She is one of those chefs who cooks and tastes while they cook.		</p>

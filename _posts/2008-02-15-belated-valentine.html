				Due to the sickness of a cute little girl in our household and Nate's cramming sessions for the GMAT to be taken this Saturday, we let the day of love slip by unintentionally. No gifts were exchanged, no flowers were bought, and definitely no chocolates since either one of us are big fans of the cocoa bean, especially me.</p>
<p>Kenzie finally got rid of her fever by mid-day Valentine's Day. However, the runny nose and cough still lingers. Not much of a break for me since she only napped for an house, compared to her usual 3 or more hours. After four STRESSFUL and unpleasant days for both Kenzie and me, yesterday was the first day with the light of hope. By that time, my mind was still recovering, which meant not much thinking of what to do for Valentine's Day.</p>
<p>Nate made dinner and we stayed up watching pointless TV and playing Dr. Mario on Nintendo 64 until way passed our bedtime. And we enjoyed every second of it since Kenzie was sleeping peacefully in her bed.</p>
<p>Today Nate and I went out on a lunch date. I had to get out because I've been stuck in the house since Sunday. Today is the first day in a week where Kenzie felt well enough to go out. So Kenzie and I took a stroll around Target and PetSmart looking at the pets with no desire of purchasing any live animals, or dead ones.		</p>

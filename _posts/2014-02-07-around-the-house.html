				Nate has been working a lot still. He is hoping to finish up on his work project before the baby comes. And after the baby is here, he would just have minor touch ups and bug fixes. He has been working from home which is a blessing and a curse. The girls see him more. As in they see him sitting up in our loft in front of the computer as they walk by. Sometimes they will go say a few words to him and say hello. And not commuting for him so that saves money on gas and time. But that also means he works more hours from home. He wakes up and hops in front of the computer to start working. He works through lunch and breakfast eating at the desk. Then he finishes up around 4:30 or 5 p.m. to eat dinner with us. He helps put the girls to bed then goes back to work until around 11 p.m. or midnight. That's what he does Monday through Saturday. Taking only Sundays off.</p>
<p>I've been trying to do some things here and there with the girls because we just need something to do. Also the weather has been crazy around here with storms and even snow. So we've been stuck in the house for a while.</p>

<p>We went out to Smallcakes for some yummy cupcakes.</p>

<p>Did a lot of drawing and coloring.</p>

<p>Trying to pull some educational stuff into it too. Helping Laney get ready for kindergarten and get Lai Lai started on her alphabets and numbers.</p>

<p>One morning we were woken up by the tornado sirens.</p>

<p>The girls love to hang on dad as much as they can when he is not working, which is not very often. So they take advantage of whatever time they have with him.</p>

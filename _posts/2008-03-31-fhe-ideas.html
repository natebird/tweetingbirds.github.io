				For some unknown reason, the bishopric had asked us to teach yesterday's combined Priesthood/Relief Society lesson at church. The lesson was on how to have successful family home evenings. So Nate and I came up with a list of 158+ ideas for FHE for everyone (singles, newly weds, young families, older families, and empty nesters). I'm posting the list we came up with for you to get some ideas for FHEs. They are not all original ideas from us, but this list should give you enough ideas to last you three years.</p>

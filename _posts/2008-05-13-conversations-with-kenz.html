<p>
				This morning in her bed, I heard this through the baby monitor.</p>
<p>"Supie Why. Alpha Pig. Tom Thumb. Run apple. Princess Pea. Read book."</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Translation: </span>She watched an episode of Tom Thumb on her favorite show, Super Why, the other day. She was talking about Tom Thumb and how he hid in an apple on the show.</p>
<p>After I got her out of bed, diaper changed, and dressed, we had the following conversation.</p>
<p>M: Daddy bedroom. [As she runs to our room looking for Nate]<br />T: Nope, daddy is at work.<br />M: Daddy working.<br />T: Yup, daddy is working.<br />M [Holding her Elmo doll]: Elmo stay here mommy.<br />T: Yes, Elmo and Kenzie stay with mommy.<br />M: Wei Wei stay here.		</p>

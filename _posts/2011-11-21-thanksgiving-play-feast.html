				Kenzie had her school play and Thanksgiving feast. Being one of the room moms I was in charge of coordinating the feast. I made little Mayflower ships filled with M&amp;Ms for each of the kids in her class. And I got parents to sign up to bring food for the feast. It was more of a brunch since it was 10 a.m.</p>
<p>The play was pretty cute. Kenzie was a turkey in the play. She had been singing all the songs to the play all week. She did very well. And Nate was able to work from home that day and go to the play and feast with us. Kenzie's class did the play with two other kindergarten classes. Her teacher narrated the play. I really like Kenzie's teacher. She is so good with the kids. And Kenzie is learning so much from her.</p>

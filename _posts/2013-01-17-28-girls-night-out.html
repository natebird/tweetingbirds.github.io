				For our friend Irene's birthday we went out to eat dinner at Provino's. I had never been there before and it was a super yummy Italian restaurant. There were about 13 of us there celebrating Irene's birthday. We were there from 5:45 till 7:30-8. We just had so much fun talking and chatting. I learned that the spoon they gave me with my plate was for twirling noodles onto my fork and not for shoveling the pasta in my mouth. And I just had such a great time with these lovely ladies. It's fun that I've been friends with some of these ladies for 6 years now. There wasn't a dull moment, only tons of laughter. Great time. And the food was delicious.</p>

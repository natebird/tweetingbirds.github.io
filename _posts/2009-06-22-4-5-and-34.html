				<span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;"><b>Kenzie at 34 months…</b></span>
<ul>
<li>Learned our address. It took a couple of days for her to remember it once it put it to song. I have been wanting to teach her our address for a while, you know, in case she gets lost. I know, I'm crazy and paranoid. </li>
<li>Is on the polite kick which I love. Lately she has been learning about being patient and saying polite words (please and thank you). </li>
<li>Is not shy around people. She will talk their ears off. </li>

<li>Is walking in <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/05/scared/">parking lots</a> again. Each time we go out, she says to me, "Mom, this time I'm going to be brave."</li>
<li>Finished the library vacation reading club in one week. Got her name on the board at the library, a free kids meal at Chic-fil-A, and a free Curious George book. </li>
<li>Sorry to say, is quite like her mother. She does things that totally reminded me of myself when I was a little girl. I'm not quite sure if that's a good or bad thing yet. Only time will tell. </li>
<li>Loves to help Mom and Dad with anything we are doing.</li>
<li>Is the best big sister to Laney. She gives Laney lots of hugs and kisses. </li>

<li>Still loving Disney princesses. Right now she is going through the Princess Aurora phase and loves Prince Philip when he gets tied up by Maleficent. </li>

<li>Loves to sound out words and figure out how to spell them. I'm still trying to help her memorize how to spell her name. </li>
<li>Loves to eat peanut butter sandwich (no jelly), peanut butter (by the spoonful), turkey ham and cheese (not in a form of a sandwich), mac and cheese (I sneak in squash puree in there), strawberries, yogurt, and ice cream. She is getting much better about trying new foods.</li>
<li>Loves to swing.</li>
<li>Has an opinion about everything. Likes to tell people what to do. Particular about having things a certain way. Little miss know it all. </li>
<li>Doesn't like to get dirty unless it's stomping through water puddles. But it means she doesn't like to play in the grass because it gets her feet dirty, even with shoes on.</li>

<p><b><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-size:large;">Laney at 4.5 months…</span></b>
<ul>
<li>Is as cute as ever.</li>
<li>Has such a fun personality because she is a happy and content child. Kenzie was a serious baby, always a serious expression on her face. Laney smiles a lot. </li>

<li>Getting much better at falling asleep on her own and <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/06/breaks-my-heart/">sucking on her thumb</a> less. She is back to sleeping 10 hours at night and nursing every 4 hours during the day. </li>
<li>Absolutely loves watching Kenzie play and prance around the house. </li>
<li>Loves being with Daddy. He's the only one who can get her to laugh out loud all the time.</li>

<li>Also good at grabbing hair. </li>
<li>Constantly kicking and flailing her arms in the air.</li>
<li>Loves baths but not the pool. Hates it when Daddy dunks her in the water (only to her neck). </li>
<li>Still teething but no teeth. Just drooling on everything and chewing on everything.</li>

<li>Is not a big fan of tummy time after the first minute. </li>
<li>Knows how to roll over onto her tummy. Does it all the time in her sleep. Just can flip back over onto her back.</li>

<p>Looking at my second grade student ID, you may notice a big mistakeâ€¦ with my name. Second grade: my first year at Laie Elementary in Hawaii; met my first American friend, Natalie van Tassell (now Gardner); came to school not knowing a word of English; and began school winter semester, halfway through the school year.</p>
<p>Now back to the name part. My mom, recently remarried at the time, changed her last name to her newly married name, Boice. Well, I guess since in my school records my parents both had the last name Boice, my teachers assumed that it was also my last name. Sure, why not? Especially since I called my stepfather, dad.</p>
<p>Well, it turns out, my last name was Ping, not Boice. But since at school, my teachers wrote Tiffany Boice on everything, I wrote that too. It wasn't until THIRD GRADE when my dad (stepfather) finally noticed I was writing the wrong last name on everything. My parents had to rectify that mistake. It can be confusing when all of a sudden what you thought was your name was really not your name and you've been saying and writing the wrong name for a whole year!		</p>

				Over the summer we bought plane tickets to Washington to visit Nate's parents for Kenzie's fall break from school. It turned out that Randy started to do pretty bad health-wise. Cyndi called and was pretty worried. So we bought tickets for Nate to go out to Washington a week before our trip. He was out there working and helping his parents do some information transfers and set up some business stuff with Heaven's Best and the Rexburg apartments. Then Nate flew home Wednesday so he could fly back out to Washington with the rest of us so I didn't have to fly by myself with three kids and pregnant. I was grateful for that.</p>
<p>We had a fun 10 days there in Washington. We got to see Nick for a day while he was up there helping his parents with financial and accounting stuff. We also got to see Nicole and Alex over the weekend since they live in Seattle now.</p>
<p>While we were there they were still trying to manage Randy's pain. He actually had a surgery while we were there to deaden a nerve that was shooting pain throughout his body. It helped some. He was still getting fluids in his abdomen. And they were setting up radiation to try to shrink the cancer nodes that were causing the fluids.</p>
<p>We still try to make good memories for the girls. We wanted them to spend time with grandma and grandpa. They had such a great time at their house. Laney got an UTI right before we left. Then she caught a fever while we were there, probably from the flight out. She then broke out in a rash all over her body probably from the fever or the amoxicillin she took for her UTI. So she was actually down for a couple of days. Luckily it was just a fever and nothing else. She was fine the rest of the trip.</p>
<p>We ate lunch at Dairy Queen. Our first experience there (Nate had been there before. The rest of us hadn't.)</p>

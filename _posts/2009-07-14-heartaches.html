				Kenzie had a rough Sunday, it just wasn't her dayâ€¦ mood-wise.
<div></div>
<div>On the way home from church, my brother Jeffrey rode with us.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Jeffrey: Kenzie you look sad.</div>
<div>Kenzie: I am sad.</div>
<div>Jeffrey: Why are you sad?</div>
<div>Kenzie: Because I have a broken heart.</div>

				My mom had this and thought it was be fun for me to post it with the other "Just Like Me" photos of me as a child and Kenzie. She made this scrapbook page of Kenzie on the left and me on the right around the same age doing exactly the same thing.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R5nnc1VP3dI/AAAAAAAABKU/sfFMUKonERs/s1600-h/IMG.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5159409330668166610" /></a>		</p>

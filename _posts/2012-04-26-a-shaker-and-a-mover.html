				Lai Lai is all over the place. She loves to stand and pull herself up on furniture. So she pretty Â much crawls just to get to furniture so she can pull herself up so she can stand. I know she will be walking soon. This was exactly what Laney did. Laney crawled at 7 months so she could pull up on furniture then she was walking by 9 months. It's going to get crazy! And what's scary is Lai Lai has similar personality as Laney. It'll be interesting to see how this all goes.</p>

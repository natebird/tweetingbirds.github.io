<p>
				I will be turning 30 at the end of next April, about 6 months from now. I decided to make a list of things I wanted to do before I hit the big 3-0. Wow. 30 always seemed so old to me. But I'm feeling better about it as I inch closer to my next birthday. So here's my list, not in any particular order.</p>
<ol>
<li>Eat sushi. I love sushi and haven't had it in forever!</li>
<li>Read the Book of Mormon entirely again.</li>
<li>Lose the last 5 pounds of weight to get me to my weight before I had kids.</li>
<li>Travel somewhere I have never been before.</li>
<li>Make myself a skirt.</li>
<li>Catch up on family blog. As you can tell, I'm so behind.</li>
<li>Make ice cream using my ice cream maker. Bought one, still haven't used it yet.</li>
<li>Read a book. I love to read, but I haven't read a book, cover-to-cover, in a long time because I've been so busy.</li>
<li>Get my hair cut. I'm going to let it grow out first then chop it off in the spring.</li>
<li>Write a list of memorable moments from the last 30 years of my life.</li>
<li>Sleep in past 8 one morning.</li>
<li>Make a new friend.</li>
<li>Go to a sports game.</li>
<li>Eat at a local restaurant that I haven't tried before.</li>
<li>Buy something nice for myself, something that I want and not something I need.</li>
<li>Take a class. Learn something new or improve upon a skill.</li>
<li>Talk to a non-member about the church.</li>
<li>Bake bread from scratch.</li>
<li>Spend one-on-one time with each daughter.</li>
<li>Go on a nice date with Nate.</li>
<li>Help someone in need.</li>
<li>Write down my testimony.</li>
<li>Take an entire day off. Probably to catch up on family blog.</li>
<li>Go to a concert or a show/play.</li>
<li>Gather five Chinese recipes from mom.</li>
<li>Interview my parents.</li>
<li>Interview Nate's parents.</li>
<li>Have a girls night out, going out and doing something fun.</li>
<li>See an old friend. Old not in age but someone from my past.</li>
<li>Go to the temple and doing a session.</li>
</ol>
<p>P.S. For my birthday, rather than a cake I want the apple pie from Whole Foods. Yummy!		</p>

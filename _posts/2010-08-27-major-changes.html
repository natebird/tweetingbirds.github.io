<p>OK, so you followed me to WordPress. You must love me. Or you must love photos of my kids. Either way, I'm glad you are here.</p>
<div>
<p>Welcome to our all exclusive, private, members only family blog. Don't you feel special? It's not that we want to exclude people into our personal lives. It's all about excluding the weirdos from our private lives. And especially since <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com" target="_blank">Simply Modern Mom</a> has quite a following now, I want to have control over what is published about our family, photos of my children and so forth. You understand, right?</p>
</div>
<p>As you can see, the site has totally changed. We have pages at the top where you can <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/the-birds/" target="_blank">read our bios</a> and see a <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/others-who-tweet/" target="_blank">list of our friends and family's blogs</a>. And Nate mentioned before that you can <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/08/all-the-benefits-of-being-private-none-of-the-drawbacks/" target="_blank">subscribe to this blog even though it's private</a>. Awesome, right? That way you will always know when I post something new without having to come to the site as long as you subscribe to it in your RSS reader.</p>
<p>We have categories and tags on the right hand side. You can search for particular post or browse through our archives. Now, I just need to catch up on the last few months. I will try my best to keep this updated. I've realized that if I don't keep this regularly updated, then I get too far behind. Apparently we have a lot of stuff going on.		</p>

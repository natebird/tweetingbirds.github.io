<ul>
<li>Laney is doing great - eating, pooping, peeing, and sleeping. Yesterday she started to be more alert and awake during the day.</li>
<li>Laney is doing great following in her big sister's footsteps being a mild tempered child, sleeping great, and only crying when she is hungry or needing to be burped. Although, she is developing a habit of wanting to nurse to sleep, I'm working on breaking that habit. </li>
<li>Kenzie is the most wonderful big sister. She is gentle and nice to her baby sister. I don't have to worry about Kenzie hurting Laney in any way. She turned 2 1/2 yesterday. What a big girl!</li>
<li>Kenzie is having a little difficult time adjusting to the amount of attention she is receiving, mainly from mom. She has been acting out slightly by bringing out a bratty attitude and wetting her pants every once in awhile. I was expecting it. But nothing major and compared to what I've heard from other parents, Kenzie is still mild tempered even with the bratty attitude. I have been doing my best to give her some one-on-one time with mom and making sure she knows I am listening to her. </li>
<li>I had a bit of a slow start with nursing. I couldn't get enough milk to come in to keep up with Laney's hunger. I had to supplement her for a while with formula. But after talking with lactation nurses, I am taking herbal supplements that has increased my milk supply and make me smell like maple syrup. As of yesterday, I didn't have to supplement with formula any more. Yay! I did not want to go through the whole formula thing. </li>
<li>I have been doing well recovering from labor and delivery. I was recovering so well that I decided to go out Saturday night to run errands with the rest of the family. Well, I over did it that night and have been recovering from that since. It's hard for me to sit still when I start feeling good. </li>
<li>Nate's mom, Cyndi, has been with us for the last two weeks. She has been a great help cooking, cleaning, helping with kids, going grocery shopping, etc. I'm going to miss having meals made for me! It has been nice visiting with her also. She will be leaving us tomorrow and will be greatly missed. </li>
<li>Nate is in limbo right now with his side business. His first client he has been working for are unsure about some things and has yet to get back to Nate with status updates. And a few weeks back he interviewed for a job that seemed promising, but then the company hired a new CEO who is reviewing the company budget. Until further notice, he placed a hiring freeze. So we're just trying to stay positive and count our blessings.</li>

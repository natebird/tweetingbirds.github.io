				After a fun morning at the pool today, we came home for lunch. As I heated the lunch in the microwave, I got Kenzie started on some yogurt at her chair at the table. When the microwave beeped indicating it was done, Kenzie yelled out, "Nathan! Come eat, dinner time!" I didn't realized I yelled that phrase often enough for Kenzie to remember it.		</p>

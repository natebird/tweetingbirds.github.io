				So last week we were smothered in snow outside. It came down quickly on Sunday night and by Monday morning we had 5 inches of snow. Then it turned into ice because it would melt then freeze over night. Crazy. School was out for the entire week. Nate worked from home all week. That was nice. No one left their house all week. I was going a little stir crazy by the end there. Finally on Saturday Nate and the girls wanted to go outside to clear off the driveway and sidewalks.</p>

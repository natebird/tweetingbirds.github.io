<p>This month the re-opening of the Atlanta Temple has been the hot topic here in Georgia. We are more than excited to have the temple open near us again. It was hard to make the 3 hour one-way drive to the Birmingham Temple because it ended up being an all day trip, including a time zone change. The Atlanta Temple was closed for almost 2 years for complete interior remodeling. We signed up to go the first day of open house to tour the temple. It was amazing.</p>
<p>It was also fun to go on the first day of the temple open house because my dad's ward was volunteering as ushers and tour guides. It was a busy day, tons of people showed up from around the country to see the temple. We went in the evening at 7 p.m. We saw a few families from our ward. We saw some families we knew from my parents' ward. Then we ran into my dad, he was working as a tour guide, at the very end.</p>
<p>The temple was amazing. The interior has completely changed. And it was so awesome to show the girls where mom and dad were sealed in the temple. If it wasn't for the open house, they might not have gotten that chance. Loved it and can't wait to go back soon!</p>

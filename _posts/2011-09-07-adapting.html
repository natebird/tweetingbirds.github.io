				Lots of changes going on here for us. Here are some things I've noticed…</p>
<ul>
<li>I wasn't getting enough milk to feed Lai Lai. I was having to supplement and nurse and pump which took 1 1/2 hours each feeding. The lactation nurse gave me a Rx to take and that has helped increase my milk a bit, but still not enough to feed her fully. So now I nurse and supplement with formula.</li>
<li>I am nervous about Nate going back to work at the office. He was off for a week then worked from home for a week. And this week he started back at the office. He has been such a huge help.</li>
<li>Kenzie is having the hardest time. She is having baby-like behaviors and pouting and throwing tantrums. Not liking this.</li>
<li>Laney is loud. She has one tone and it's loud. She doesn't know how to be quiet or talk with softer voice.</li>
<li>I don't do well with little sleep. I already knew this. But it's much more of a reality now that I'm in the middle of not sleeping.</li>
<li>Lai Lai has yellow discharge coming from her left eye. We are lucky to have our optometrist as our family friend and he called in a Rx for us last Thursday night. That has helped.</li>
<li>My hardest thing is getting all of us on a workable routine. It's pretty much impossible to get us on a schedule that flows with Kenzie in all day kindergarten, the girls dance classes, Nate's work, and Lai Lai's feeding and napping schedules. We are still trying to figure things out.</li>
<li>I have forgotten how hard it is to get a newborn on a regular schedule. For the most part she is pretty good but each day it is still varying schedule so I'm trying to get her on a feeding time that works with the rest of our schedules.</li>
</ul>

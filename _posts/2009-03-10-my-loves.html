				Since I have been back in YW, two weeks now, Nate has been taking both kiddos on mutual nights. What an amazing husband! I came home last Thursday and saw this happening in Kenzie's room. Although this picture looks all calm and peaceful, Nate will tell you that 5 minutes before this picture was taken, Laney screamed her lungs out for the whole two hours I was gone. And Kenzie had a nasty accident in the tub during her bath. To sum up daddy's night that evening, Nate said, "Laney was pressing my nerves tonight. Now I know what you go through every day."</p>
<p>Nate is the world's best dad and I am so grateful for him.</p>

<p>
				I think 2010 ended up being a wonderful year for the Bird family. The biggest blessing being Nate having a job after almost 2 years of unemployment while he was in school. Looking back at it, I can't believe we survived all that. I see all the miracles and blessings that has happened in 2010. It is such a testimony builder for us. And I think we had the best time being poor. Even though we have a paycheck coming in now, we have our major debt to pay off (student loans, 1 car and our house). So let's just say being poor doesn't end with Nate getting a job. But we are grateful and will stay resourceful. It's the only way to be.</p>
<p>I, personally, was also able to accomplish a lot of things in 2010. I'm grateful for the opportunities I had. I made some amazing new friends and kept in touch with old ones. I was able to learn new skills and keep sharpening old ones - sewing, calligraphy, photography, crafting, organizing, communicating, cooking, baking, etc. I have always wanted to learn how to shoot completely in manual on my camera. And I was able to learn that in 2010. That's all I do now is shoot completely in manual and using natural lighting. I'm excited to take a composition photography class in January from one of my favorite photographers in California, Nicole Hill Gerulat. Her Photo 101 book was the one that got me shooting in manual. It's going to be awesome.</p>
<p>I also picked up calligraphy this year. Another thing I have always wanted to learn. I still have a lot to learn about it and many hours of practicing. But as with pretty much every other skills I have, I am self-taught. So it takes discipline, patience and time that I sometime don't have. I love calligraphy though. I am trying to learn more of the copperplate style. It's gorgeous.</p>
<p>I am so grateful that even though we had our tough financial times, I was able to stay home and be a homemaker. There is not price that someone can pay me to leave my children and have someone else raise them. But that's my own personal feelings about it. I know many moms out there have to work to survive or for other reasons and that's fine. I am grateful that in our family situation, I am able to stay home with my children. It has been such a blessing in my life.</p>
<p>Along with motherhood, I believe that as women, we need to have hobbies, interests, friends and time for ourselves. That was the whole reason why I started blogging at Simply Modern Mom. I love to write and I have a college degree in communications and print journalism. I want to use that skill. I have times when I have to do more than feeding the family, changing diapers, breaking up girl fights and cleaning. I love to learn, to connect with people and to sharpen my mind. I love to be challenged mentally. A huge reason why I love to craft and learn skills on my own. This year, Simply Modern Mom did pretty well. My RSS and email subscribers are up to 2,500+ and by the end of the year I was able to get my site stats up to 50,000 readers a month. It shocks me that many people actually care to read what I write. Ha! I also set a goal of getting 1,000 Twitter followers by the end of the year. It was a close one, but now I'm around 1,030 on Twitter and 900 on Facebook. SMM takes a lot of work and time, but I love doing it even though it hasn't been very profitable. This is one of those things that it's not about the money. It's about doing what I love. And that's why I've been doing this for a year and half now. And I'll keep doing it. I actually turn down a TON of money making offers and free stuff on SMM because I don't want it to turn into a site reviewing products, doing a ton of giveaways and misleading my readers with "in content" ads. It kind of bugs me when people start a blog with the sole purpose of making money from ads and getting free stuff. That just tells me that you're not into the art of blogging and connecting with people. You're just doing it for the money.</p>
<p>Anyway, enough about that. I have some goals for 2011 too.</p>
<p>I want to fit into my clothes. It's not so much about losing weight for me, although I have about 10-15 pounds I can do without. It's more about how I fit into my clothes. So I really need to get moving - literally. I need to get the motivation to exercise. It's for my own health.</p>
<p>I want to make more time for friends. My schedule is usually overloaded that I really do need to set aside more time for friends. I love spending time with them, so I need to do more of that. And I want to make a few more friends in 2011 too. It's always great to meet new people.</p>
<p>I want to learn a new skill. All the while improving upon my photography, sewing and calligraphy. I love learning and challenging my mind. I love trying new things. I am excited about a photography class I'm taking in January. It's going to help me with composition.</p>
<p>I want to keep dating Nate. We've made it through our Project 52: Date Nights in 2010 where we went on a date once a week. It was so good for our marriage. We did simple at-home dates most of the time. And even that was enriching to our relationship. We are going to keep it up next year too.</p>
<p>Those are the main ones. Here's to another year!		</p>

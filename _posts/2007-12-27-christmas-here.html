				This year we stayed here for Christmas. I was glad we didn't have to travel cross country this year, but I did miss spending the holidays with Nate's family. So we did the usual for Christmas whenever we're here. We, along with all the rest of the extended family, went to Grandma and Grandpa's house. The day usually begins with each individual family opening gifts in their own homes. Then having a delightful Southern breakfast at Lori and Greg's. We missed that this year since Kenzie woke up late and it's an hour drive for us to Lori and Greg's. I did get to talk to my brother, Jeffrey, serving in the Utah Ogden Mission. He sounded so good, enjoying the work. Finally we went to my grandparents' house for a huge dinner with everything that is included in the traditional Christmas feast. We also exchanged gifts and did our family crazy gift swap. It's like a white elephant, except the gifts are $20 or under. It was a full house with 40 people in attendance. But it was so wonderful to have everyone there (with the exception of my cousin Wayne). Kenzie had a great time with so many cousins to play with, about 4 close to her age.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R3PTmutV2QI/AAAAAAAAA4I/1eBSjC2Lq1U/s1600-h/IMG_7099.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7099.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5148691461341305090" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R3PTmutV2RI/AAAAAAAAA4Q/qR3FvhYm_gY/s1600-h/IMG_7112.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7112.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5148691461341305106" /></a>		</p>

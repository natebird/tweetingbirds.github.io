I was reading through some of the articles while Kenzie ate her pink strawberry ice cream tonight. Curiously Kenzie asked what I was reading. I slid the magazine over to show her. I told her I was reading words from our prophet and apostles. She looked at some of the pictures and said, "I remember those guys." I had printed out pictures of the prophet and apostles to show Kenzie while we watched General Conference at the beginning of April. Here we are a month and half later and she remembered seeing their pictures. Amazing. </p>
<p>So I thought I would take the opportunity to flip through the magazine with Kenzie. We studied pictures of people at conference, identified the Salt Lake City Temple, talked about Angel Moroni on top of temples, counted and named the 12 apostles, and discussed Jesus. By the end of the short unplanned FHE Kenzie learned the name of our prophet, Thomas S. Monson. I was so excited for her that we called my parents and my brother so she can tell them the prophet's name. (We tried calling Nate's parents, but they didn't answer.) </p>
<p>I love how the Ensign can provide easy, no planning involved FHEs.		</p>

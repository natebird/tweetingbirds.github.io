				Randy and Cyndi finally made it here! The last time they saw Kenzie in person was May 2007, before Kenzie started crawling. They arrive at our house around 7:15 a.m. Wednesday morning after a redeye flight. Of course, Grandma and Grandpa showered her with new clothes when they arrived. We surprised them with their early birthday, Mother's and Father's Day gift, family tree. The first day we just hung around the house and spent some time visiting. Kenzie also knew exactly how to melt the hearts of her grandparents… she learned to say "Grandma" and "Grandpa" on their first day here.</p>
<p>Day 2 we went shopping at Home Depot for my new kitchen light fixture and paint for our entertainment center. Cyndi also had a great time shopping for quiet toys for Kenzie's church bag. Kenzie definitely felt loved getting showered by all these surprises Grandma and Grandpa would give her after a shopping trip. She went around the rest of the day saying, "Grandma… Surprise!" There were lots of picture taking opportunities of our little star.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8hsL9fuXLI/AAAAAAAABdU/mSjFpU4XjPc/s1600-h/IMG_7441.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7441.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5172503124777000114" /></a><br />Getting gifts from Grandma upon their arrival.</p>

She spent her nap time talking and jibbering to herself. Then we hear her said, "Uh oh!" I went into her room to see what happened and she had taken off her pants and threw it out of her crib.</p>

We gave it to them early because we didn't want to ship the big frames.</p>

When Nate's dad, Randy, visits, we usually find one or two house projects for him to work on because he loves doing things like that.</p>

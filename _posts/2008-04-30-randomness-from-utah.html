				OK, this is the last post about our Utah trip, I promise! Thanks for putting up with me through it all. We just had so many memorable moments in Utah on this trip. It was so much fun! Here are some moments that didn't quite fit in any of the other posts, so I decided to do a hodgepodge of random things from our trip.</p>
<p>On the Monday of my arrival, I spent that evening with Nate's siblings having dinner and Family Home Evening at Natalie and Nicole's apartment. It had been a long while since Nick, Natalie, and Nicole had seen Kenzie. We ate delicious spring rolls for dinner with the siblings, Jessica (Nick's girlfriend), and Carrie (Nicole's friend). Then Nick gave a wonderful lesson with interesting visual aids (see picture below).</p>
<p>Then Tuesday morning, I met my friend, Elizabeth Osborn, at the University Mall. She is a high school friend who has moved to Utah and is now officially a Utahan. We had a great time going around the mall, looking at stores, and catching up on life. It was so great seeing her.</p>
<p>I had the fortunate opportunities to eat Cafe Rio twice on my trip. Those of you who haven't heard of Cafe Rio, you are missing out. It's the best Mexican food in the world! I keep trying to convince Nate to open a Cafe Rio back home just so I can gain 50 pounds eating there. It was the only thing I craved during my pregnancy with Kenzie. However, I didn't have enough time to fit in L&L;'s (Hawaiian restaurant in Provo) and Jumba Juice.</p>
<p>I was sad to have miss several other friends who are there in Utah. I attempted a trip to the BYU Bookstore to see my old boss, Todd, at the framing department but the bookstore closes at 6 p.m. now! I was also sad to have miss seeing my other family in Orem, the Pinegars. They were on a trip to Holland during my visit. It sounds like I'll have to plan another trip out to visit with all the people I missed.</p>
<p>On Saturday, Nate's family went to the Salt Lake Temple to do a live session and the sealing of Nate's Grandma's parents. I was not able to go because while we were in Utah, I realized my recommend was left back at my house. Therefore, I spent that morning repacking all our luggage since Nate decided that morning to stay in Farmington that evening. Later that afternoon, we (Nicole and Jessica, Nick's girlfriend) met up with the rest of the family at Cafe Rio in Salt Lake City. Afterwards, we went up to Nate's uncle and aunt, Bob and Janet McKeen's house in Farmington (north of Salt Lake). By the time we got there, we had missed Kenzie's nap time. And that night, when we tried to put her to bed early for our 6 a.m. leave to the airport the next day, Kenzie couldn't sleep with all the ruckus going on. We had both sides of the family hanging out, playing games, and running around Bob and Janet's house which woke up Kenzie. So the poor little girl didn't sleep until 9:30 p.m., when she passed out due to sheer exhaustion.</p>
<p>However, Nate and I had a great time visiting with both sides of the family and playing the couch game that Saturday night. The family also did a birthday celebration for my big 25. Nate and I went to bed early for our crack-of-dawn flight while the rest of the family stayed up playing hand and foot (a card game) and fugitive outside.</p>
<p>We ended our trip with a easy (compared to my <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/04/airport-scare/">flight out</a>) trip on Frontier Airlines again. All went well except Kenzie was a bit difficult to handle due to lack of sleep from the previous day. She didn't sleep during the whole four hour flight back home. She did crash shortly after we landed at our final destination.</p>

<p>Here I am blowing out the candles on my birthday cake. This was actually a reinactment because the first time I had to blow out the candles fast, before anyone could pull out their cameras, because one of the candles burned down a stick holding up a candle. That's why the "2" candle is at the bottom.</p>

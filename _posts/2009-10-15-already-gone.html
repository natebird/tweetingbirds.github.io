				Last week, Nate left the kids and I home all alone while he attended his sister's wedding in Connecticut. Funny side note, NYC people will get a kick out of it, too:
<div></div>
<div>The morning after dropping Nate off at the airport.</div>
<div>Kenzie: Is Dad still at the airport?</div>
<div>Tiffany: I hope not. He should be in Connecticut now.</div>
<div>Kenzie: Connecticut… that's the wild. Wide open spaces.</div>
<div>Tiffany: [laughing because I made the connection that she's quoting the movie, <i>Madagascar</i>]
<div></div>
<div>Back to my point… I have said this many times, but it really is bitter sweet when he is gone. All of us girls miss him dearly. But the girls and I thrive on a more structured schedule since I'm the only one running the show. I seem to get more things done with him gone. I stay busy to keep my mind off his absence. </div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Wednesday,</b> after dropping Nate off, we headed over to my dad's. He's a bachelor for seven weeks while my mom visits her family in Taiwan. I made him dinner and got home after the kiddos' bedtimes. </div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Thursday,</b> ran the daily routine. Spent some quality time cleaning the house, put things back in order. Ran to the pediatrician's office to drop off poop samples (more on this in tomorrow's post). Got back home in time for the kiddos' naps, but neither one of them took a nap. Made dinner then headed over to the church for mutual with two grumpy kids. Came home and put both in bed. </div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Friday,</b> ran the daily routine. Determined to not go anywhere because I had so much to get done at home. Worked on projects, more cleaning, and got kids back on their regular routine.</div>
<div></div>
<div><b>Saturday,</b> ran errands. </div>
<div></div>
<div>I don't have any pictures to document this because Nate took my camera to the wedding. I had separation anxiety the whole time… calling Nate to check on my camera. It was our first time apart. </div>

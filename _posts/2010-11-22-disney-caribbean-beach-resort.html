				We stayed at the Caribbean Beach Resort at Disney. It was nice to stay on site because we were so close to the parks. We didn't mind leaving the parks in the middle of the day to go back to the hotel for a little down time or swim at the pools. We didn't even get to explore everything at our hotel. But it was really cool. The hotel room was nice a spacious. Pretty decent although I thought they could have done a better job at vacuuming (there were crud under the beds) and dusting (like the ceiling fans and wiring behind the TV). But that's just me. And this is finally, my last post about our Disney trip. We had a great time and hope to return someday.</p>
<p>Glad to get out of the car after an 8 hour drive.</p>

<p>Ooo… Aaaa… Look at that hotel!</p>

<p>The hotel had MANY buildings. Outside of our building was this view. We had our own beach and playground and pool.</p>

<p>The main pool was awesome. It was Pirates of the Caribbean themed. Lots of slides and water falls. And the kiddy pool was so fun.</p>

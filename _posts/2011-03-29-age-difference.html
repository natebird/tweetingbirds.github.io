				Laney: I want to watch movies.</p>
<p>Tiffany: No, you've already watched a movie today. You watched Mulan.</p>
<p>Laney: [excitedly] Watch Mulan again?</p>
<p>Tiffany: No we're not watching Mulan again. You're slick.</p>
<p>Laney: [excitedly with big eyes and holding up her fingers] I'm 6?!</p>
<p>Tiffany: No you're not 6. I said <em>You're slick</em>. Silly girl.		</p>

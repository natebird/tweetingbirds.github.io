				There is absolutely no time left. Aaahhh! I can't believe it's summer already. It just means Kenzie will start school in <em><strong>two</strong></em> months. I'm not ready for that. I have a ton of worries and concerns that are going through my head. Just imagining all the cruel things kids do to each other these days. Yikes. And these two months of summer is going to go by in a blink. All I can do is savor each moment, right? And it's helping that I am currently reading Dale Carnegie's "How to Stop Worrying and Start Living" book. Dale Carnegie… He's a classic.</p>
<p><strong>June</strong></p>
<p>Beach vacation with my family. It's an annual event where we head to the beach each summer and rent beach houses. We turn into beach bums for a week, get some much needed R&amp;R, maybe even a tan, then head home to hit the grinds. Our family haven't been on one of these beach vacation in three years because Nate was in school. So we're excited to go this year! The girls are going to love the sand and ocean. We are definitely beach people here - sorry lakes, ponds and rivers.</p>
<p>Kenzie and Laney are also signed up for summer dance classes. They both have classes Saturday mornings. Laney is in a bitsy ballet class that's 30 minutes for kids who are 2 1/2 - 3 1/2 years old. Kenzie is in a ballet and tot hop (hip hop for little kids) combo class for 45 minutes. So I'll be hauling kids to dance classes for 5 Saturdays in the summer.</p>
<p><strong>July</strong></p>
<p>Nate's family is having a family reunion. For the first time since our wedding seven years ago, all eight kids will be together. His twin brothers will be home from their missions the week prior to reunion. And three of his siblings are brining their fiancé/significant other to the reunion. We'll meet them for the first time. There is a high possibility that 3 of Nate's siblings will have a wedding by the end of this year. Two of the three are already engaged. And we won't be making it to any of their weddings because of the baby coming and Nate is completely out of vacation/sick/holidays for the rest of this year.</p>
<p>So the plan is we'll all fly out in July (technically I am not supposed to be flying by two weeks, but I didn't want to stay home by myself) for a quick two days of traveling and four days of reunion in Washington. It will be so much fun being with all the Birds. But there is also a pretty packed reunion schedule including a day at the temple, talent show, a day at the lake, hiking (which I won't be doing) and much more. It's going to be crazy because there will be 24 people staying in Nate's parents' house. They have a big house, but not for 24 people.</p>
<p>Around this time we should be looking into purchasing a new (new to us, but used), larger vehicle with no money. We just spent all our money on going out to Washington and the beach vacation and dance classes and a new baby coming. Dang. Nate and I are both dreading getting a bigger family vehicle. Why would anyone purchase a larger, gas sucking vehicle right now when gas is around $4-$5 a gallon?! We can't afford to pay for gas, nonetheless the car payment and insurance, to drive it anywhere. We're trying to see if we can fit a third car seat in the Honda first. If we can put off getting a new vehicle we will.</p>
<p><strong>August</strong></p>
<p>Two weeks after we get back from Nate's family reunion, Kenzie starts school. So I have two weeks to unpack, maybe get all of us adjusted to a new school schedule, attend the school open house and purchase school supplies and clothes. Oh, and plan something for Kenzie's birthday, which will happen the second week of school. She's a young one for starting kindergarten. <em>And</em> fall dance classes will start for both Kenzie and Laney two weeks after school starts.</p>
<p>Oh, should I also mention that a baby is coming? Probably around 2-3 weeks after Kenzie starts school. Talk about an adjustment time for all of us. <em>And</em> Nate's brother is getting married August 20th. We won't be attending the wedding but will be sending our wishes from the hospital with a new baby.</p>
<p><strong>The Cherry On Top</strong></p>
<p>Somewhere in these summer months I would like to potty train Laney. I have a feeling that probably won't happen until after the baby arrives. Plus Laney has no interest in potty training right now. She's going through a rebellious stage of not wanting to wear clothes. She prefers the nude.</p>
<p>On the baby forefront, I am 29 weeks along, give or take a week. At my last ultrasound they said I was measuring a week early. So who knows when this baby will come. I can't believe I have only about 10 weeks left of this pregnancy. I haven't done anything to prepare for baby's arrival. Absolutely nothing. And noticed we still call her baby? Yeah. We can't come up with any names for this child. There is a trepidation that she will remain unnamed even after birth. Names for baby, especially the third girl, is so hard! We ran out of good girl names after the second child. We don't even have ones we are contemplating. Nothing sounds good to me. Any suggestions for girl names? Aside from the name, I haven't done anything else for this baby. I haven't been nesting at all. Haven't made anything for the baby. Haven't bought anything for the baby. Haven't even thought much about doing anything for the baby. We've been so busy with everything else, it's crazy. I already feel like she's getting neglected. Sad.</p>
<p>Oh, and I'm hoping I might get released from my callings (primary teacher and activity days leader). If not, I will at least be out for a while when the baby comes.</p>
<p>Can you see why I'm having a panic attack? There are a lot of things going on here. Before I know it, the year will be over. Nate and I still have lots of things to figure out. But we are also excited for all the opportunities we have coming up.		</p>

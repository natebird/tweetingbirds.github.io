				Kenzie is really lucky to have such great friends at school. Her two best friends are Giselle and Elie. Elie was in her class last year and they became best friends last year. Elie and Giselle knew each other from preschool. The three of them would play at recess. Then when they all moved up to 1st grade and were placed in different classes. Luckily, they had the same recess still. So the three of them chase boys and started the Sparkle club at recess. This year I have gotten to know Giselle's mom from meeting up at the parks a few times and then doing play dates with the girls. We had Giselle over for a play date before the Christmas break. She is such a nice girl. And after New Year, Kenzie and Elie went over to Giselle's house for a play date. The nice thing is Giselle has a sister, Lily, who is 6 months older than Laney. She they play together too. Elie only has older siblings. The three of them are so cute together. I love it. </p>
<p>One of the great things about having Kenzie in a public school is the opportunities she has in meeting new people and learning how to make friends everywhere. She has really blossomed the last two years being in school and learning to deal with social issues. Not all good, but not all bad either. She has really matured. And she has also had opportunities to stand up for what she knows is right. As a parent, it's a proud moment to see your child use what we have taught her at home to use in her own life. </p>

<p>And earlier this fall, we would meet them at the park for play dates. And little sisters get to play along too. They love hanging with the big girls.</p>

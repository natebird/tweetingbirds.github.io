<p>
				We have been in our house for almost two years and we haven't put a paint roller to the wall until now. I have been hesitant because the first year, our house had a warranty that would replace and fix just about everything wrong with the house, but if we painted, the builder wouldn't repaint or touch up.</p>
<p>Also, I am indecisive about the perfect color for each rooms. I have no interest in repainting it if the colors didn't turn out just right. I think it's a lot of time and trouble to keep repainting. So it must be right the first time.</p>
<p>And lastly, we only put work into the house when we can do it for "free" - Home Depot gift cards from our credit card rewards points. We had enough this time to get three gallons of paint (enough for the kitchen and living room), paint supplies, and wire shelving for the laundry room for our food storage.</p>
<p>After a late start, Nate and I took on the task of painting the living room while Kenzie napped on Saturday. Once she woke up, we stuck her in front of the TV with about 3-4 hours of Barney on tape while we finished up our painting. Thanks to the cooperation of Kenzie and Nate's amazing, efficient painting skills, we finished the living room in about six hours (with some breaks in there).</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of our success!<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SI4bTBOE2iI/AAAAAAAACaQ/2F-PLW9DZbI/s1600-h/IMG_8899.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8899.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228146230982662690" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SI4bTQZVb7I/AAAAAAAACaY/YyLWfmDmRdc/s1600-h/IMG_8903.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8903.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228146235056418738" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SI4bT6SteJI/AAAAAAAACag/k0rdHKdHgIc/s1600-h/IMG_8907.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8907.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228146246302922898" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SI4bUAu5xwI/AAAAAAAACao/qjIhbqLuzjs/s1600-h/IMG_8908.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_8908.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5228146248031782658" /></a>		</p>

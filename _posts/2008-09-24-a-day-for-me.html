				You hear about all sorts of weird, made up holidays dedicated to celebrate something someone felt important. Well, now I have my own. Kenzie made it up for me.</p>
<p>As I am coming to the end of my 5th month of pregnancy, I am still frequenting the bathroom. At the sonogram, we found out it's because the little angel in me is breeched and kicking directly at my bladder.</p>
<p>In one of my many trips to the bathroom today, Kenzie joined me in the room and announced, "Mommy, it's your pee pee day in the bathroom. Now flush it."		</p>

<p>
				This is what I heard over the baby monitor this morning when Kenzie woke up, "I didn't eat my dinner and Mommy put my food away. I was crying. Then I couldn't eat dessert." Funny how the first thing she thinks of in the morning is how Mommy disciplined her last night for not eating her dinner.</p>
<p>After a while, she opened her door and came into our room. Obviously hungry because she didn't eat her dinner last night, this was the conversation we had.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Come on mom, let's go downstairs and eat some food.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> Can I eat Kenzie?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> No. We eat food.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> But I want to eat Kenzie.<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> No. I'm not food. I'm a princess. I make princess noises and I do princess things.		</p>

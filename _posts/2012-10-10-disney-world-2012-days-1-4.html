<p>We were at Disney World a total of 8 days and 7 nights, from Sept. 15-22. We got up regular time Saturday the 15, but regular time means 6:30-7 a.m. for us. The girls don't really sleep in much. I packed all the clothes and food and everything else the day before. Saturday morning all we had to do was load things in the car and we were off by 8:30. It was a good 8-9 hour drive so we wanted to go as soon as we could. We stopped once for lunch in Valdosta and filled up with gas. It was funny because we stopped in the exact same place for dinner and gas on the way back home the following Saturday.</p>
<p>We got to our hotel around 4 p.m., checked in, unloaded and unpacked. Went out to dinner using our meal plan at Wolfgang Puck Express at Downtown Disney. We walked around there a bit and then headed to the grocery store to grab some breakfast stuff for the hotel.</p>
<p>A funny thing while we were unpacking at the hotelâ€¦ As I was putting all our clothes in the dresser in the hotel, I noticed that Nate didn't pack any garments. Haha! I packed all my stuff and all the girls stuff and everything else. I even helped Nate pick out clothes for the week. All he had to do was pack the clothes, do his toiletries and garments. He forgot the garments. Luckily his mom packed extra new garments for his dad, so he borrowed some.</p>

<p>Nate's parents arrived in the evening on Saturday. They flew in from Washington and took the Disney shuttle to the hotel. We kept the girls up a bit so they can see grandma and grandpa. Then we put them to bed and the adults stayed up watching the BYU vs. Utah game. We had connecting rooms so we had the kids in bed in our room and then we would stay up hanging out in Nate's parents' rooms. We brought the baby monitor this time just for this reason.</p>
<p>Day 2 we went to Epcot. It was a Sunday and we just had a day of traveling on Saturday for both parties. So we decided Epcot would be a nice relaxing way to ease into our week of Disney. I also worked out nice that we saw a lot of the characters on our first full day so the rest of the week we didn't have to wait in line for characters as much.</p>

<p>Day 3 we were in Hollywood Studios. Fun rides and amazing shows. Then we stayed up for night show, Fantasia. A little scary for the girls. And a little late, especially for Lai Lai. But all in all, they had a great time. We didn't get to do everything we wanted to do there. But that's with everything at Disney. There's always more to do.</p>

<p>Day 4 we had breakfast at Cinderella's castle in Magic Kingdom. This was our first time doing this at Magic Kingdom. Last time we ate with the princesses was at Epcot. The girls loved it, of course. Kenzie dressed up as Cinderella again and her bear had a matching outfit. Laney dressed up as her favorite Princess Aurora and her bear also had a matching dress. Lai Lai dressed up as Snow White and her bear had a Rapunzel dress. The adults also had an amazing time. Nate's parents were pretty impressed with the meal and the whole princess castle atmosphere. We had some time to do some rides before we got rained out and realized that we had left our ponchos and umbrellas back in the van. We decided to end the day early and hang out at the hotel for the afternoon a bit. Then we went back to Downtown Disney with Nate's parents this time to do some shopping and had dinner there.</p>

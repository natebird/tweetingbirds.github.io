				Freshmen year of college. My friends and I decided to wander around Park City, Utah, during the Sundance Film Festival to see what celebrities we can spot. We heard Jennifer Aniston was promoting her movie, "The Good Girl" at one of the showings. So we went and waited outside the theater. It was awesome because we got to see Jennifer and Brad Pitt, this was back when they were married. And Jake Gyllenhaal and John C. Reilly. I was only able to snap pictures of Jake and Brad and a part of Jennifer. I had a film camera at the time and they were walking out of the theater rather quickly.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SbGa0r2oFZI/AAAAAAAAENA/QBaNSJWucD8/s1600-h/IMG_0076.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;width: 320px; height: 290px;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0076.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5310195665562244498" /></a>

				Last week Kenzie said to me out of nowhere about the day when Laney was born. I figured that since she has never been to the hospital before except when I had her and when I had Laney.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, you got sick and went to the hospital. Then I went to the hospital and found Laney. Then I decided to keep her.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Um, you didn't pick Laney and mommy wasn't sick. Laney was in mommy's tummy and I had to get her out. And since mommy gave birth to her, we were definitely keeping her.</p>
<p>Kenzie: How did you get Laney out?</p>
<p>Tiffany: Mommy pushed her out. [Simple as that, right?]</p>
<p>I was trying to end the conversation there before she started asking how the baby got in my belly.		</p>

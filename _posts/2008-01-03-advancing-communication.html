				Kenzie is getting much better at communicating with us on what she wants and doesn't want. She now has a preference on what she would like to eat. When she is hungry, the two of us play our parts and the act goes something like this.</p>
<p>Kenzie walks to one of the two places where she knows her food are stored, the pantry or a cabinet next to the kitchen sink. If she is by the kitchen sink, she points to the cabinet showing me she wants something in there. If she is at the pantry, she is hanging onto the door knob trying to twist it open. When I open the cabinet or pantry, she points at what she wants. It's usually something she can't eat (uncooked macaroni or a box of cake mix). I pull out something she can eat, such as pretzels, crackers, cookies, and so forth. She tells me, "No," and shakes her head or nods her head with excitement. It usually takes two or three tries before I find something she is interested in tasting.</p>
<p>She also likes variety in her meal. Usually wanting several courses per meal. And she will tell me if she is not finished eating. I will ask her, "Kenzie, are you finished?" She responds with, "No!" Then points to something else she wants.</p>
<p>Here is a list of words she can say or animal sounds she can make. She doesn't say most of the words with perfect annunciation, but it is usually clear enough for Nate and I to understand. And she will be 17 months next Wednesday.</p>
<p>Animal Sounds:<br />Cat<br />Dog<br />Snake<br />Cow<br />Duck<br />Bear<br />Elephant<br />Owl<br />Sheep<br />Monkey<br />Bird<br />Santa Clause (not an animal, but he says, "Ho! Ho! Ho!")<br />Car (also not an animal, but says, "vroom vroom")</p>
<p>Words:<br />Puppy<br />Pumpkin<br />Bubble<br />Hi<br />Bye<br />Cookie<br />Cracker<br />Bib<br />Uh oh<br />Bathroom<br />Hot<br />Cold<br />Car<br />Close<br />Open<br />No<br />Down<br />Go<br />Oh no<br />No way<br />Bath<br />Mouth<br />Mom<br />Daddy<br />Night Night (also what she calls her favorite blanket)<br />Ball<br />Bee<br />Fish<br />Milk		</p>

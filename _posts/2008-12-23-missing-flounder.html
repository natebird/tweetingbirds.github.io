I have searched everywhere in the house and all over her playroom for it - nothing. Today, he showed up out of nowhere while Kenzie was playing with it and her Disney princesses. At this point, I was curious to know where she found that little guy.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, where did you find Flounder?<br />Kenzie: [nonchalant]  He was swimming under the sea.		</p>

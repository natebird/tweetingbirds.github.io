				Kenzie went in for her first dental cleaning and checkup on March 21. We go to a family friend dentist and his staff were amazing with our little Kenzie. I have been hesitant to take Kenzie in because she has a fear of machine noises (car engines, vacuums, blender, bathroom fans, toilet flushing, drills, lawn mowers, breathing treatments, etc.). So you can imagine taking her to the dentist where they are all sorts of machine noises up close and personal. But as she has gotten older, this fear has softened. Plus we had to take her in for her to register for school.</p>
<p>She did so well at the dentist and had her cleaned and checked. The best part for me… No over bite and no cavities. Yay! The best part for her… Princess stickers and glove balloons. She just chatted away with everyone in there. She was quite the show. And the dentist said her bottom two in the front are starting to loosen so they could fall soon or take it's sweet time. She's an early bird, of course, since she those first two teeth cut through when she was 3 1/2 months old. She will be excited if they do fall because she's been talking about her teeth falling for a while now. I keep telling her it'll be a long time since she's only 4 but she just had to prove mom wrong.</p>
<p>After the dentist she kept talking about how she has a beautiful princess smile now because her teeth are clean. I love it.</p>

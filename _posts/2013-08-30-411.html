				It has been a month but I think we are finally in a routine. Phew. August is always a busy month for us and this year, it wasn't any different.</p>
<div></div>
<div>Kenzie started school at the beginning of August. And then she had to turn 7 on me that first week of school! How dare she. She loves second grade and has a fabulous teacher. Her two best friends, Giselle and Elie, are not in her class but the three of them have the same recess so they are happy. She has a few other friends in her class that she knew from kindergarten and first grade and she met a few new friends. We are so blessed that she is in a great school. This year she is dancing ballet, tap, and jazz. She is working on getting her splits down. She is also trying her first year in competition dance which requires rehearsals on Fridays or Saturdays a couple times a month. So far she loves it. And it has also helped her with her techniques and learning more advanced moves. On top of all that, she is doing her first year in piano. Her teacher is a sweet, older, southern woman who is so good at teaching children piano. Kenzie enjoys going each Wednesday for lessons and is picking up piano rather quickly. So far she has been good about practicing piano at home on her own. I can only pray she stays that way forever. :)</div>
<div></div>
<div>Laney is also loving life. She is doing speech therapy at Kenzie's school once a week. Her biggest challenge is slowing down when she speak. Her mind goes faster than her mouth which causes some occasional stuttering at the beginning of sentences and slurring of words. She loves going to Kenzie's school and loves her speech teacher. Laney is doing her third year in dance. This year she is doing ballet and hip hop (new this year). She is pretty good at dance so she is actually in a dance class with girls who are a year older. This is her last year home with me so we plan on working her her writing and alphabet sounds before starting kindergarten.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Lai Lai is talking up a storm. She speaks in 5-6 word sentences and will have a full conversation with anyone. She loves to do whatever her sisters are doing. She also had a birthday in August. It's not that hard to believe that she is 2 because she has been acting 2 for a while. Being the youngest also means she goes with mom and sisters everywhere. Luckily she is easy going and doesn't mind so much waiting and waiting for her sisters to do their stuff. She loves nursery, she is my only child who never had a problem going to nursery. She also loves the color orange, another first to not like the color pink. She is sassy and quite smart. Not sure if that is a good combination. :)</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nate is back to working normal hours mostlyâ€¦ at his regular job. The FDA panel is coming up in October for the heart sensors so he is doing a lot of work getting his part ready. He has also picked up two side jobs doing websites for Utah Olympics and Zions Bank. When he is not working, he spends time with his girls or help me run them to their various activities or doing church stuff for the bishop. And he still does stuff here and there for Tough Old Men. He has been reading Narnia with Kenzie. They are both enjoying that very much. The girls also wants him to teach them tennis so Nate bought all the girls kid size tennis rackets and balls.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Me, well I try to keep up with the girls. Mondays are the busiest because we have dance, speech, and I volunteer in Kenzie's class helping the teacher do various stuff. When I am not running the girls to classes, rehearsals, school, play dates, dentist and doctor appointments, or birthday parties, then I am at home cooking, cleaning, getting things ready for the next day, running errands, volunteering, or writing. I am also helping out with Tough Old Men stuff here and there. And my calling has me in several stake meetings, conference calls, youth conference, and interviews. A lot has been happening in our stake lately that we are trying to get the media involved. So that's exciting. My blogging and crafting has taken a back seat for the moment but that's OK. I am doing lots of other things that I enjoy, such as being with my children and making new friends with parents of their friends, and getting things published in papers for our stake.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Motherhood is not easy but is such an amazing blessing. I am extremely fortunate that I am able to stay home with my girls. Even though we run around everywhere and are involved in a lot of things, we are having fun, making memories and staying busy in good works. The girls are learning so much, having so much fun, and making so many great friends. They are able to develop talents and gain a confidence at such a young age. And for girls, that will help them when they hit the tween, teen, and adulthood. We are also very blessed to be surrounded by such great people who teaches and supports my children. It does take a community to raise a child. And I hope to show my children that they can be one to make a difference in their own community. But most importantly, I hope what we teach them at home builds a strong foundation in their lives.</div>

<p>Kenzie at 38 months…
<div>
<ul>
<li>Ever so lovely. She looks so grown up in all her pictures. And she has an attitude of a 5-year-old. </li>
<li>Thinks she is always right. </li>
<li>Curious about everything. </li>
<li>Loves to learn and her mind absorbs everything.</li>
<li>Would live off peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and mac & cheese if I would let her. Good thing I make her try new foods. She actually discovered she likes zucchinis and squash. </li>
<li>Still obsessed with Disney Princesses. Knows all of their songs. </li>
<li>Memorized two disks of the Children's Primary Songbook songs.</li>
<li>Can quote the entire movies of Madagascar, Shrek, Shrek 2, Mulan, The Little Mermaid, The Bee Movie, and Aladdin.</li>
<li>Singing all day long, even makes up her own songs.</li>
<li>Getting a little better at sharing and being nice to her sister. The taking away Kenzie's toys for not being nice has worked.</li>
<li>Still goes down for quite time for two hours whether she naps or not.</li>
<li>Learning to read words by sounding out her alphabets. </li>
<li>Loves doing preschool workbooks. I'm looking into a little of homeschool preschool stuff with her.</li>
</ul>

<div>Laney at 8 months…</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Is a mover and a shaker. Crawls everywhere. </li>
<li>Pulls up on furniture and walking along them.</li>
<li>Does not like to be held unless she is facing out and looking at everything.</li>
<li>Is not a cuddler any more. Makes me so sad.</li>
<li>Loves nursing. I'm worry about having to wean her. She's not going to like that.</li>
<li>Such a happy little girl. Always smiling at everyone, even when she is sick.</li>
<li>Still sucking away at that thumb. </li>
<li>Grinds her teeth, yes, those front ones. It drives me insane.</li>
<li>Popped out tooth #5 (top left) with #6 not far behind. </li>
<li>Loves to clap and do the motions to this Chinese nursery rhyme my mom taught her.</li>
<li>Gobbles down yogurt, rice puffs, and crackers. </li>
<li>Drinks from a cup.</li>
<li>Takes two 2-hour naps and sleeps 11 hours through the night.</li>
</ul>
</div>

				Kenzie woke up this morning around 5 because she had an accident in bed. She was also wheezing and coughing. She didn't go back to sleep. The rest of the day she has been wheezing and coughing and moaning because she can't breathe. She also has a slight fever. We have been giving her breathing treatments and Tylenol. </p>
<p>One of the hardest thing for me as a mom is to watch my kid sick and not feeling good. I just want to snuggle them up and do anything to help them feel better. She has been a good trooper trying to be happy even though she's not feeling good.		</p>

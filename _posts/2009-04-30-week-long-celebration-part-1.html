				Nate and I have our birthdays exactly a week apart. I had mine this past Sunday (my golden birthday) and then Nate has his coming up this Sunday. This year, we made it a week long celebration of both our birthdays.</p>
<p>The day before my birthday, we participated in the national Day of Service by the church. Although there were so many people who participated that most of the services were accomplished within an hour. We arrived a bit late and missed out on the big stuff. Oh well, maybe by next year we'll get the hang of getting two kids ready and out the door on time.</p>
<p>Later that afternoon, still last Saturday, we ran errands, took Kenzie to the park. I decided to attempt to make myself an ice cream birthday cake. I have never had an ice cream cake before. I don't know why not since I LOVE ice cream? The cake kept getting bigger and bigger and soon turned into an ice cream tower. I used vanilla ice cream as the frostingâ€¦ scrumptious!</p>

I left early for ward council and got home late after missionary correlation meeting. Came home, stuffed my mouth with dinner, cut the cake and ate a piece in 5 minutes, then left again for the stake recognition fireside. I saw my kids maybe three hours that day.</p>

He got them ready for church and had them in bed by the time I got home from the fireside. He made my birthday so special with sidewalk chalk in the driveway saying,<span style="font-style:italic;"> Happy Golden Birthday, Tiffany!</span> And having Kenzie make me a birthday card. I loved that!</p>

<ol>
<li>Dinner made. I also didn't want to decide on what to eat. I needed a break from cooking and deciding what to eat each night.</li>
<li>A half day off. Just half day of uninterrupted time to get some projects accomplished. I'm redeeming this on a later date.</li>
<li>A blog makeover. Nate is redesigning my blog as you will see later.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have such a wonderful husband who made all three birthday wishes came true. I love him!</p>

				Still posting stuff that happened in the past. But at least I am done with Christmas, right? This is Laney's 3rd birthday. We haven't given her a party with friends yet. So this was her year. It was fun to see her get excited about her party. She had such a great time with her friends. We had her party at Chick-Fil-A where they pretty much took care of everything. We told them what theme and colors we wanted and they decorated, packed goody bags, blew up balloons, they set up the whole thing and cleaned up in the end, provided a kid's meal for each child and even ice cream for each child. All we had to do was show up and bring the cake. Easy enough.</p>
<p>Few days before her birthday I made her a count down where each day she got to peel off the number and see something special she got to do that day. It made it even more exciting.</p>

<p>Here she helped make her own birthday cake. I went with a pink theme for her birthday. Simple enough and it was her absolute favorite thingâ€¦ everything pink. Kinda feel bad for the two boys who came to the party. It was so pink.</p>

<p>I did a little more to make it a little nicer and personalized. I made a name tag for each child's table placement. And I also made a little thank you tag to go on some bubbles to put in the goody bags.</p>

<p>I made a layered strawberry birthday cake with strawberry frosting. Then I made some cupcakes just in case we didn't have enough cake for everyone at the party. I also made a little banner garland for the cake that said "Happy Birthday Laney".</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5552" title="IMG_2874 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_2874.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="347" /></p>

<p>Chick-Fil-A also provided a little craft for the kids but I also brought some other crafts for the kids to do while they waited for the food to come. The craft provided was a cup that they colored the inserts. Then I brought crowns and glasses for the kids to decorated with foam stickers. I also got each kid a kazoo lips. It was very cute.</p>

<p>They ate their meal, then Daisy, the Chick-Fil-A cow came out to visit with the kids. Each kid got to sit on her lap and take pictures. Lai Lai wasn't very happy to see the cow.</p>

<p>Sang happy birthday, ate cake and ice cream, opened presents then went home. We gave Laney her presents from us at home. She had such a great day. It turned out so lovely.</p>

<p>
				I have been feeling a little under the weather lately, my symptoms:
<ul>
<li>My house stinks. It still has the new house smell after living in it for almost 2 years now.</li>
<li>Occasional nausea feeling.</li>
<li>Craving fried eggs and french fries. </li>
<li>Crying when Nate is gone all day for church and work duties. </li>
<li>Hunger every 3-4 hours but even though I feel like I am starving, I can't fit much in my stomach.</li>
<li>Eating a lot of sweets or constant smell of sweets makes me nauseated. </li>
<li>Craving lots and lots of fruits. </li>
<li>Can't stand the smell or the look of Chinese food. </li>
<li>No energy or sleepiness usually around 4 p.m. and later.</li>
<li>Frequent trips to the bathroom, even in the middle of the night.</li>
</ul>
<p>I went to the doctors last Monday and this was their diagnosis.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/SNAVknpdLZI/AAAAAAAACig/N_t_2SQdfVs/s1600-h/IMG_0001.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_0001.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5246717284748963218" /></a><br />The doctor said I would get rid of the source of the illness around Jan. 30, 2009.		</p>

				Lai Lai is growing up much too fast for my taste. It's not right. All in one week she started to do this… On Easter Sunday she started getting up on all 4s and scooting using her feet to kick off. Then by that following Tuesday she started to use her knees more to crawl.</p>

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-5309" title="IMG_3631 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_3631.jpg" alt="" width="520" height="520" /></p>
<p>She also learned to have more hand coordination and can pick up little puffs and put it in her mouth.</p>

<p>And on Wednesday, she crawled to the couch then pulled herself up! Aaahhh! The two older girls are not very fond of this new skill as Lai Lai gets into their toys now.</p>

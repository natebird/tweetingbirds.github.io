				I haven't posted at all this week because I have been sick. I got it from Kenzie who had it all last week. I had a fever yesterday, and it finally broke last night around 11. Today, I feel much better! Nate helped out so much last night by taking care of the house, playing with Kenzie and cooking dinner. I was able to get in bed by 9 p.m. and sleep away my fever and illness. So, to catch up on what has been happening...</p>
<p>This past week, Kenzie developed a new part of her personality that I am convinced it came from Nate - mischievousness! It's the part of their personality that is there to push my buttons and drive me crazy. I would like to consider myself as a decently patient person. I try not to freak out about the little things, even though I am a clean freak. I make all efforts to create an atmosphere and environment in my home that encourages fun and creativity. However, these last few days, Kenzie has been testing my limits, just as Nate did with his mother (example: setting the backyard on fire or bouncing a ball in the kitchen knocking over a pot of soup on the stove after his mom told him not to bounce the ball in the kitchen).</p>
<p>Another reason why I am convinced this mischievousness came from Nate is because they both try to play it off as being cute or funny. They both do things they are not supposed to and then give this cutest expression on their faces and giggle like it's funny. Kenzie likes to sit on my lap while I am on the computer. She grabs the pencils from the pencil and pen cup on our desk. I would get out a piece of paper for her to draw on. She then removes the paper and draws on our white desk even though I have told her many times that is not acceptable. But she would point to her drawing on the table and say, "Uh oh," and continue to draw on the table.</p>
<p>Kenzie also ate a green crayon last Saturday. She saw her friend, Chase, put one in his mouth and she decided she would try it, but take actually bite off a piece. It didn't taste good, so she spit it out everywhere. But even though she didn't like it, she still tried to take more bites off other colors. Maybe she thought different colors had different tastes and wanted to try them all.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R72d7AScUFI/AAAAAAAABXY/5lwWxfAoSsg/s1600-h/IMG_7370.jpg"><img style="float:left; margin:0 10px 10px 0;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7370.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5169461584306393170" /></a><br />This is Chase and Kenzie playing last Saturday. When Kenzie sees Chase at church, she always points to him and says, "Chase!"</p>

<p>For Family Home Evening this past Monday, Nate decided to play a game with Kenzie. So he hid a ball under one of the three cups, shuffled, and asked Kenzie to pick the cup with the ball in it. She actually did pretty well with the game.</p>

<p>This is also who she gets her big mouth from. Kenzie is able to stuff huge amounts of food in her mouth and make it disappear within seconds without choking.</p>

<p>Kenzie likes to change the diapers on her stuffed animals.</p>

<p>In order for me to change her diaper, she also requires me to change the diapers on her stuffed animals. They all take turns on who needs a change.		</p>

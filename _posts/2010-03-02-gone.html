<p>
				Friday morning Kenzie comes into our room.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, where's dad? I didn't see him and Laney downstairs.<br />Tiffany: Daddy is at school.<br />Kenzie: But I was sleeping for a long time and daddy still didn't come home from school.<br />Tiffany: Well, daddy came home last night after you went to sleep and left before you woke up.<br />Kenzie: I miss him.<br />Tiffany: Me too.</p>
<p>Just recording what our life is like right now.		</p>

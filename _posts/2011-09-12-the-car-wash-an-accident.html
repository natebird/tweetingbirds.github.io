				A few weeks ago Nate had the girls help him wash my minivan. The girls had a great time getting wet and washing the car. Nate's goal is the wash the car once a month. I wouldn't mind. I like having a clean car.</p>

<p>P.S. I just had to mention that Nate was the first one to put in ding in the minivan. He thought I would be the first to hit the side mirrors on the garage door but nope. It was him. As he pulled out of the garage he hit the passenger side mirror on the garage door. It cracked the case and put a scratch on the outside. But it's just cosmetic damage. Not too noticeable.		</p>

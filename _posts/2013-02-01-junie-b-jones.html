<p>Kenzie started reading Junie B Jones books March of last year. Her first book she took with us to San Francisco and read it on the trip. At first she was intimidated by the book because it was a chapter book. But after the first one, she wanted to read more. She loved them. She breezed through them reading one in just 4-5 hours. I'm OK with Junie B. Jones books. It bugs me that she speaks in improper English. She says some "bad" words like stupid or dumb but that doesn't bother me as much as the grammar.</p>
<p>Anyway, I searched on eBay to see if I could find the entire series. I got it for a pretty good price from eBay and it was missing two of the newest books. I got those off Amazon and Laney got one from the Scholastic book sale for Kenzie for Christmas. Now we have the complete set and she was already done with it. She read the two she got for Christmas (the last two books) on Christmas day.</p>
<p>The tricky thing with Kenzie is she reads so fast. Her first grade teacher did evaluations at the beginning of the year on her and she reads 160 words per minute. She said they try to get 2nd graders to read half that speed by the end of 2nd grade. She was doing twice as fast at the beginning of 1st grade. Her trouble is her mind reads faster than she can read out loud. So when she reads out loud, she skip words.</p>
<p>I gave her The BFG by Roald Dahl and she started it on a Tuesday evening, finished it by Sunday. It was a book the teacher was reading aloud to the kids in class. She wanted to read it herself at home. She finished it before the class finished it. I told her she couldn't tell the class the ending. She had to keep it a secret. It's great that she loves to read and reads fast but she is plowing through books way too fast. She got her AR cap (40 AR points where most books are 1 or .5 AR points) at the beginning of December. She is now into the Ready, Freddie books. She wants to be an author and illustrator when she grows up.</p>

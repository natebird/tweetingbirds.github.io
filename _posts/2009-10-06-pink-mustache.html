				Early last week I gave Kenzie a yogurt smoothie drink (picture below). She drank it and it took her a while chugging it down.</p>

<p>When she finished, I cleaned her up and noticed a pink mustache on her upper lip. Thinking it was the strawberry yogurt, I wiped it off. Oops, it didn't come off.</p>

<p>What was that? Looking closer and after much thinking, I said, "Oh, that's a hickey." She sucked on the yogurt bottle to the point where it left a hickey mark. Ha! Later that night when she was brushing her teeth, she noticed in the mirror that she had a "pink mustache."She wanted me to wash if off and I had to explain that it will remain on her face for a few days. She smiled and said, "I have a hickey!"</p>
<p>Dang, she heard me. The next few days, she told everyone she had a hickey on her faceâ€¦ she was quite proud of it, too. She even painted a picture of her hickey for her grandma. Nice. She's the only 3-year-old with a self inflicted hickey on her face.		</p>

<p>
				I'm a subscriber of many friends and family blogs, I even have a RSS reader that tells me when there is a new post. I see my friends and family getting tagged by their dearest friends and family who makes them answer random questions to help everyone get a better insight to their personal lives. I love reading them because I learn all sorts of random facts and trivia about my friends and family. But I knew the day would come when I would get tagged and would have to share weird stuff about us... So here I go. I actually got tagged twice and so I'll answer both tags in this one post.
<ul>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold; ">What is your name?</span> I am the type of person who goes by many names... It's actually a complicated story since it took me until 4th grade to figure out my real name. But for the sake of the question, I usually go by Tiffany.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">How long have you been married?</span> 4 years this May.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">How long did you date?</span> 2.5 months until we got engaged (I just figured that out a month ago because Nate always told me we dated 3.5 months until we got engaged), and another 5 months until we got married (we were engaged for 5 months).</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">How old are you?</span> 24, going on to 25 this April... sad, a quarter of a century old.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who eats more?</span> I would like to say Nate, but I guess we each have our moments of gluttony.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who said "I love you" first?</span> Nate, only a week after our first date. And he was serious about it too.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who is taller?</span> Definitely Nate. I personally don't care to beat 6'2".</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who sings better?</span> Me, I can always beat him in Karaoke Revolution.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who is smarter?</span> Nate with numbers, me with words.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Whose temper is worse?</span> We pride ourselves with not having a temper. I don't know if it's true or not.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who does the laundry?</span> Me and only me. It's a strategic challenge for me to fit a certain amount of clothes in the washer with the right colors washing in cold cold water to save energy. And timing the dryer just right so it dries the clothes perfectly. Then the final race of folding and hanging the clothes before it wrinkles.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who does the dishes?</span> Mostly Nate. He once told me he likes doing it because he gives him some insight to what Kenzie and I do every day. So I let him have all the insight he wants.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who sleeps on the right side of the bed?</span> Nate. We tried switching sides one night and neither on of us got any sleep. Never again.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who pays the bills?</span> Me. I don't think Nate wants to know where all the money goes.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who mows the lawn?</span> Nate, I grew up in a household where the guys did the yard work.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who cooks dinner?</span> Me. Just about every night... we don't go out much for food.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who drives when you are together?</span> Nate. I hate driving.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who is more stubborn?</span> Both! We are both the oldest child in our families.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who is the first to admit when they are wrong?</span> Nate, and he does it with this innocent boyish charm.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Whose parents do you see the most?</span> Mine, since they only live 35 minutes away. My parents also have to see Kenzie at least once a week or else "She won't recognize us!" Nate's parents live in Washington.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who proposed?</span> Nate, after taking an economic test that angered him all day.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who has more friends?</span> Me, the socialite.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who has more siblings?</span> Nate. He comes from a family of 8 children. I come from a family of 2 children. We have completely different childhood memories.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Who wears the pants in the family?</span> Nate wears the pants, I wear the skirts. I don't think he would look good in a skirt.</li>
</ul>
<div><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Second tag... List 7 random things and tag seven people...</span></div>
<ol>
<li>Nate and I have a mutual friend, Natalie van Tassell (now Gardner) who we met at different times in our lives before Nate and I even met. Natalie was my 2nd grade best friend in Hawaii. And Nate worked with her in the computer labs at BYU. Nate and I went to Natalie's mission farewell party together and she was baffled by the fact that two people she knew from two separate occasions met and were dating.</li>
<li>Both Nate and I are not chocolate people. I hate it... won't eat it at all. No Oreos, no frosties at Wendy's, no hot cocoa, no ice cream sandwiches, no white chocolate and absolutely no brownies or German chocolate cakes. Although now they have come out with vanilla frosties, vanilla cookie ice cream sandwiches, and vanilla Oreo cookies. Nate is not the extremist like me. He will eat chocolate from time to time. But he doesn't crave it. It's not his preferred snack or dessert.  </li>
<li>Nate is a huge Harry Potter fan... waits in line past midnight to get all the books (except for the ones that came out while he was on his mission). He has read each book at least once and listened to them on his iPod a few more times. The only thing he won't do for Harry Potter is dress up like one of the characters, not even for Halloween. Me, I'm a Harry Pooter hater. No, I didn't misspelt the name, I call it Harry Pooter. I won't read the books, doesn't matter how hard Nate tries to convince me to read it. I saw the first two or three movies and didn't enjoy it at all. I tell Nate that I am against Harry Pooter because it is full of witchcraft which I don't believe in (I say that just to bug him). This is the biggest conflict we have in our house. </li>
<li>When we first moved into our current ward, people thought that Nate was the one related to my big extended family out here. They even thought he looked like my cousins! They could see the resemblance because my aunt, Stacey, and uncle, Scott (my dad's younger brother), are also in the ward. </li>
<li>Nate has a great time laughing at my OCD tendencies (obsessive compulsive disorder). I have not been diagnosed with OCD, I just have tendencies that I try to control myself. For example, I have a hard time with loosing thing. So to prevent that, I count pieces and parts to toys, crayons, markers, dishes, hair clips, shoes, etc. If something is missing, I know exactly which one and color and shape is missing. Then I turn the house upside down looking for that one missing piece.  Everything has its place in the house. And I know when something is missing from it's place or is misplaced. My house is extremely organized because I can't deal with mess or chaos. I have a mental inventory of everything in the house. I'm just glad that Nate doesn't<br />
purposely go around hiding things or misplacing things to mess with me.</li>
<li>We tell people that Nate and I met through friends at BYU. That's the short version. The condensed long version is I was really good friends with three guys in college, Braden, Jeff, and Grant. Grant has a brother that used to be in the same ward as Nate's parents in Washington. Grant's brother told Nate, when he was at home for the summer, about Grant looking for more roommates for a basement apartment in Provo. Nate decided to move in with Grant because the place was cheap. So that's how Nate ended up rooming with Braden, Jeff, and Grant. And I met Nate when he moved in with my guy friends.</li>
<li>We were all chunky babies at birth: Nate 8 lbs 2 oz; Tiffany almost 10 lbs; Kenzie 9 lbs 2 oz.</li>

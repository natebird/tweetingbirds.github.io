				Kenzie, we've noticed, is a bit of a pack rat. Totally against Nate and my philosophy. We are the declutter and throw it out type of people. Kenzie, on-the-other-hand, walks around the house with a clear plastic bin that is stuffed full of her princesses and other stuff. Then she finds a spot and begin to build her nest. It usually involves furniture she can move (small rocking chair, small tables and chairs), pillows, blankets, clothes and pretty much anything she can find. It's literally like a bird who goes around finding random things to build a nest with. I see it as a pile of junk that needs to be put away. She calls them her nests or forts or house or castle. It drives me nuts.</p>

<p>Last night as we were heading out the door. Nate and I were looking for Laney's socks. We asked Kenzie if she could help us find them. When she did find it, she exclaimed, "I found Laney's socks! It was in my mess. I mean nest." So true. So true.</p>

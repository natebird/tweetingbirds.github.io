				Kenzie picked out an outfit for me, pink capris and a pink shirt. However, the pinks didn't match. I wore the shirt but not the capris. Looking at what I was wearing Kenzie said in an offended tone, "What?! You're not wearing the clothes I picked for you, mom?!"</p>
<div style="text-align: center;">*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*</div>
<p>I had Kenzie in a brown outfit- plain brown capris and a brown top with pink polka dots. An hour later, I see her with her pink pajama shorts on that has blue butterflies on it. Getting ready to head out the door, I asked Kenzie to put her brown capris on again. This was the conversation.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, can you put on your brown pants, please?<br />Kenzie: But I want to wear the pink shorts.<br />Tiffany: It doesn't match your polka dot shirt.<br />Kenzie: Yes it does. Pink polka dots, pink pants. Pink, pink, it matches.<br />Tiffany: Well, we can't wear pajamas to the store. So can you put on your brown pants, please?<br />Kenzie: OK, we don't want my pajama pants to get dirty.		</p>

<p>
				When we were at Dave's wedding reception at a vineyard (Nate's best friend from high school)â€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, this is a fancy place for a wedding.</p>
<p>Tiffany: I know. It's a nice place, huh?</p>
<p>Kenzie: When I get older, I want a fancy wedding too. I want a sparkly wedding dress so I can dance good.</p>
<p>Tiffany: That'll be nice. Can I come to your wedding?</p>
<p>Kenzie: I guess so. If you want to.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Oh yeah. Mommy wouldn't miss it for sure.		</p>

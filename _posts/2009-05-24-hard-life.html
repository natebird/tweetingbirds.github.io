				Nate: Kenzie, you were not being gentle with Laney.<br />Kenzie: Yes, I was.<br />Nate: You were crushing her head. That's not being gentle.<br />Kenzie: I didn't want to be gentle with Laney because she wasn't gentle to me.<br />Tiffany: Sounds like you have a hard life.<br />Kenzie: I know I do.<br />Tiffany: Why do you have a hard life?<br />Kenzie: Because sometimes I fall down.		</p>

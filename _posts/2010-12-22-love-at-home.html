<p>Months after our trip to Disney, Kenzie still talks about it.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, I loved Disney World. It was so much fun. It's my favorite place ever. But do you know where I love more than Disney?â€¦ Our house.</p>
<p>I love it. That has been my goal: Make our home a place where our children would like to be.		</p>

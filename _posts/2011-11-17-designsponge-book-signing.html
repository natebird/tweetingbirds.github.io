				I attended the <a href="http://www.designsponge.com/" target="_blank">Design*Sponge</a> Book Signing on Nov. 3. It was a rainy night and driving to Atlanta was crazy. But I went and had such a great time. Nate watched the three kids and I was kid-free all night. I met up with another blogger, Amy from <a href="http://www.modpodgerocksblog.com/" target="_blank">Mod Podge Rocks</a>. I had met her once before from another event in Atlanta with Dana from MADE. And Amy and I have kept in contact since then. Her blog does much better than mine and is a bigger name than mine. She is so awesome and genuine person. We hung out all night, even after the book signing we went out to grab a bite to eat.</p>
<p>It was also cool to meet Grace Bonnie from Design*Sponge. If you know the professional blog community, you know how big Grace is with her blog. She is also super sweet too. And her book is pretty amazing too. They had yummy pies from a local bakery and fancy drinks there. And the fun part was the photo booth they had set up. Amy and I had a fun time being goofy with that. I love attending events likes these.</p>

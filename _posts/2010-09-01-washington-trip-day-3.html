<p>Since the girls awoke every morning at around 6 a.m., they got a head start on the day before everyone else. First thing they did was explore the yard outside. And grandma and grandpa had the perfect yard. Swings, treehouse, sandbox and everything else.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1647" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-3/p1110659/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1647" title="P1110659 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/P1110659.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></a></p>

<p>Yummy breakfast every morning… Oatmeal, parfaits, English muffins and all you can eat fresh fruit. As in fresh from the garden and orchard.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1649" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-3/p1110666/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1649" title="P1110666 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/P1110666.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>After breakfast we all got together for scripture study… Digital scripture study. Everyone had their laptops. Geeky?</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1650" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-3/p1110669/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1650" title="P1110669 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/P1110669.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="413" /></a></p>
<p>Scripture study lead right into grandma and grandpa giving Kenzie her birthday presents. Yes. That's what grandparents do. They love to give presents. And my children loves to be on the receiving end of it. I mean just look at their faces.</p>

<p>I think this was the most relaxing day of the week. Most of us had free time to go and do what we wanted to do. Cyndi loaded her house full of grandchildren supplies… Playdough, bubbles, blow-up pool, beach toys and all sorts of other fun stuff. It's an investment. They will be getting two more grand-babies by the of this year. Two boys. That will be a nice balance for our two girls.</p>

<p>The girls got into their swimsuits and was ready for water. I have two water girls. Mermaids.</p>

<p>Kenzie loves playing in the sand. So grandpa revived their old sandbox and uncle Matthew show Kenzie some tricks to building castles.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1682" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/dear-old-lola%e2%80%a6/img_5922-1/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1682" title="IMG_5922-(1) *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_5922-1.jpg" alt="" width="550" height="367" /></a></p>
<p>The was the funny thing was Nate's sister Nicole kept telling Kenzie to dump water on grandpa and grandma, not thinking she would actually do it. But she did. On grandma. Look at that mischievous smile.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-1651" href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2010/09/washington-trip-day-3/p1110693/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-1651" title="P1110693 *" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/P1110693.jpg" alt="" width="413" height="550" /></a></p>
<p>That evening, Nate's parents got a babysitter for us so all the adults can go to a play in Leavenworth where Nate's good friend from high school was playing the lead role. The play was hilarious. And the lead female role was played by his fiancée. This trip has been a fun little reunion for Nate as he hasn't seen his high school friends in a long time and missed his 10 year reunion two years ago.</p>

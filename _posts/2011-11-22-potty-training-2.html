				There is no perfect time to potty train. So being this was the first Saturday we didn't have anything on our calendar, I decided that would be the day. Plus it was Thanksgiving break that following week and we didn't have a whole lot of plans which meant we could stay home and be close to the bathroom. I hate potty training. It's one of the worst things for me to do as a mom thus far. I dread doing it.</p>
<p>The first day, Laney did OK. She had two accidents before a successful run to the bathroom. I use the <em>Toilet Training in Less Than a Day</em> book. It worked well with Kenzie and I liked it's concepts. Laney is ready to take on potty training. She is old enough to understand everything. It's just getting her to jump on the idea and taking off with it. The first day she had a great attitude toward it. And totally excited and happy when she peed in the toilet. But she also had 5 accident and only 1 successful trip to the toilet. Yikes.</p>
<p>The second day went a little better. It was Sunday and Nate didn't want to take Laney to church while potty training. So he stayed home with her while I took the other two to church. She pooped during her nap in her pull-ups. And had 1 successful trip to the potty while we were at church. Overall she had 3 successful trips to the potty and 2 accidents. Not bad.</p>
<p>Monday, the third day, I had her started out on the potty right after she got out of bed. She started out the day with 2 successful trips. Yay. But then she digressed a bit as the day went on. The next time she started to go in her pants, told me she needed to go, so we ran to the toilet and finished there. It was half and half. And the time after that she had an accident. Didn't make it at all. That was all before lunch time, which for us is at 11 a.m. But the rest of the day she did wonderful. I still had to coax her into going to the bathroom but when she does, she pees and had no more accidents the rest of the day. Nate was at work so I had to balance taking Laney to the potty and nursing and making breakfast and lunches. I tried to keep a close eye on the girl to watch for signs of her holding it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I'm not getting a lot of things done that I needed to get done since I am running her to the bathroom every 20 minutes or so. She is telling us when she needs to go to the bathroom as she is peeing in her pants. So we need to keep working on getting her there before she starts going. I just keep trying to tell myself to be patient, be consistent and be encouraging. Hopefully it will set in her mind and she will "get it" soon.		</p>

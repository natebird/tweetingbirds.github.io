<p>Seriously. How long does it take to clear the roads and neighborhoods? School and offices and stores have been closed all this week because we got 5 inches of snow last Sunday night. And then it would melt and refreeze, turning into ice, over night every night. I am not liking you right now Mother Nature. You are playing a mean game.</p>
<p>We did make some yummy snow cream. The kids loved that.</p>

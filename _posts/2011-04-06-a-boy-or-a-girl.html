<p style="text-align: left;">My sonogram appointment was yesterday and we found out the baby is going to be…</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">A girl! Yup, Nate will be out numbered with even more girls.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We're pretty happy. I wanted another girl and Nate was good was either way. This is my pregnant belly at 19 weeks. She's pretty active baby. I can feel her moving all the time and Nate felt her move for the first time this week.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Funny things that happened at this appointment…</p>
<ol>
<li>We told Laney that we were going to see the baby at the doctor's office (meaning the sonogram). We she arrived at the doctors' office she asked, "Where's the baby?" while looking around the office. She was expecting to pick up a baby and go home.</li>
<li>After the sonogram while we were getting ready to head into a room to wait for the doctor, Laney made all of us have a family hug. Literally pushed me toward Nate and started hugging all of us.</li>
<li>Kenzie wanted a sister. Laney wanted a brother.</li>
<li>Kenzie on the way home said to me, "Mom, now we need to come up with a baby's name by Monday." I told her we had plenty time to decide on a name. Ever since Kenzie knew we were having another baby she has been hoping it will be a girl and she came up with the names Emma, Daisy and Rosy for the baby. I told her that those were good names but we probably won't call the baby that. So she said she will use them for when she have daughters.</li>
</ol>

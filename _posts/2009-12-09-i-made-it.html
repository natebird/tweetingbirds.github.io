<p>Remember how I <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/11/comment-less/">frantically blogged</a> about meeting deadlines… mainly getting my shop up in time for the giveaway on another site? Well, I did it. Pat on the back to me. There are still a ton to do with the shop and supplying the shop with other items. But it's up nevertheless. I called it The Gift Box because every gift comes with a box, or some type of wrapping. See it here… http://thegiftbox.simplymodernmom.com.</p>
<p>And back in September, when <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/">Simply Modern Mom</a> was just taking off, I set a goal of having a steady 100 readers to my site a day by December 31. Well, after endless hours of stress, frustration and hard work, I am now at a steady 500 readers a day. Next, I need to work on advertisement and marketing. Sorry about the constant SMM talk and updates. It has become quite a consuming part of my life.</p>
<p>I also survived Nate's last week of school, last week. You probably don't care, but I'm writing this down for our family memory's sake. The week went like this…</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Monday:</b> Nate left for school at 11 a.m., got home at 10 p.m. He had a presentation.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Tuesday:</b> Nate left for school at 5 p.m., got home at 11 p.m. He had a paper due. We both stayed up late getting my shop finished and running.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Wednesday:</b> Nate left for school at 5 p.m., got home at 10 p.m. He had class and a take home final. I gave both girls a bath that night and Laney manages to poop in the bath water. I frantically get her out and stuck on on top of the toilet for her to finish her business. Then grab Kenzie and the toys out of the tub. Oh, the contamination! Clean the tub, then refill the tub so I could finish bathing both kids. Then while I was nursing Laney to put her to sleep, Kenzie insisted on staying in the tub to play while I did that. Not a big deal since Laney nurses in 5-10 minutes now. But as I was nursing, I could hear water being dumped out of the tub. Could it really be? Kenzie knows that's a rule, when water gets out of the tub, bath time is over. And I specifically reminded her of that rule before I left her alone in the tub. Yup… when I got back, water was all over the floor of the tub, getting into the hallway carpet. Bath time was definitely over and she got no stories that night.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Thursday:</b> I had mutual where to took the YW bowling. It was so much fun. I haven't been bowling in such a long time and bowled a 109. My beginners bowling class in college paid off. Came home and Laney had a fever of 101 and runny nose. Her canines are coming in and she stayed up until 3 a.m. crying of pain. Poor girl. I stayed up with her. Finally got her to fall asleep on my shoulders. That never happens because she doesn't sit still long enough to fall asleep when people hold her. So I was eating it up, even if it had to be at 3 in the morning.</li>
<li><b>Friday:</b> I had a YW sleepover at one of the YW's houses. I didn't sleep over, but had to bring the girls some Christmas gifts and pizzas. It's an annual tradition we do in YW.&nbsp;</li>
<li><b>Saturday:</b> I had a regional leadership training meeting at a stake center a little over an hour away. I know, I was totally complaining about it before and now I feel bad. The meeting was awesome! We were trained by Sis. Lifferth (General Primary Presidency), Sis. Dalton (General YW President) and Sis. Thompson (General Relief Society Presidency). It was amazing to have them come all the way from Salt Lake to train us personally. And to feel of their amazing spirits in person. I learned so much from them and they said all the things that I needed to hear to be a better YW President. When I got home, 6 hours later, Nate was finishing up cleaning the kitchen. He had also mopped the floors, folded the laundry and put up the curtain rod in our room. What an amazing husband!</li>
<li><b>Sunday:</b> I had meetings all day then we went to see my mom after church.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

				Rather than getting into nesting like a good mom, I have been procrastinating. I have made improvements though! Yesterday I got a baby monitor for the new one. I had Nate get baby stuff down from the attic and a small luggage for my hospital bag. Every once in a while, when I see something I will need, I throw it in the luggage. I'm not quite sure what I have in there and what I still need to put in there.</p>
<p>A quick OB update (skip this of you're sensitive to words such as membrane or dilated): At my OB appointment yesterday the midwife said I'm dilated to 2 cm (a little slower than I was with Kenzie). At my next appointment, coming up Friday, they will strip my membrane to see if that does anything. And they will also set up a date for me to be induced. I am not allowed to go over my due date since I have gestational diabetes.</p>
<p>I am hoping I can have the baby on the 29th so we can be home by Sunday. And then Nate won't have to miss his class on Monday. Hey, he's paying $130 per class, so if he doesn't have to miss a class, that would be great.</p>
<p>Until then, I'm holding the baby in, hoping she doesn't come early. I have too much to get done and I'm not sure if two weeks will be enough time. It hasn't been too uncomfortable, except for sleeping. So I don't mind going to my due date.</p>
<p>Things to get done in the next two weeks:<br />1. Clean the house! Dust, vacuum, sweep, mop, organize, put away, laundry, bathrooms.<br />2. Go through baby clothes to see what Laney will need for the rest of winter.<br />3. Finish packing my hospital bag.<br />4. Clean out the guest bedroom for the in-laws coming soon.<br />5. Put up the baby bassinet/pack 'n play somewhere in our room.<br />6. Assemble and find places to put baby stuff (clothes, swing, play mats, diapers, etc.)<br />7. Research and purchase a cute, larger, messenger, waterproof diaper bag.<br />8. Crochet matching hats for Kenzie and Laney.<br />9. Organize and turn YW stuff over to my counselors for when I'm out on maternity leave.<br />10. Pay bills and update our budget.<br />11. Help Nate do some writing for his business.<br />12. Give myself a much needed pedicure.<br />13. Get some cash for hospital parking.<br />14. Do my visiting teaching.		</p>

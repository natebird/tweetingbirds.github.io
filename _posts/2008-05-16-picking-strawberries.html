				On Wednesday, we went to a strawberry farm in Rome to pick our own strawberries. We did this last May when Nate's parents and sister, Natalie, were here visiting. We had so much fun last time. And the strawberries were nothing like what you get in the stores. These are so juicy and the most delicious strawberries I have ever had. It's so sweet and just melts in your mouth.</p>
<p>We decided to go again this year, with my parents. This year, it was $1.40/lb or $7/5 lbs if you pick them yourself. We got 13 pounds of bright red strawberries. We froze half and the other half we'll eat before the week is over. And the strawberry farm had yummy homemade strawberry ice cream that made the trip so worth it. Unfortunately, they were out of fresh homemade strawberry jam.</p>
<p>Kenzie went last year, but was too young to understand what was happening. She mostly picked strawberry leaves and ate them last year. This year she had her own bucket and had fun picking some. She decided to pick not only the red ones, but also the green ones that weren't ripe yet. I had to explain to her that the green ones were baby strawberries and still needed more time to grow. After that, she picked fewer "baby sta-bies."</p>

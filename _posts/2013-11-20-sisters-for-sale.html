<p>We didn't tell anyone we were expecting #4 until after we found out the gender of the baby. I was 19 1/2 weeks at the time. It was getting hard to hid the bulging belly. We told the girls the morning we were going in for my sonogram appointment. We kept Kenzie at home from school. My appointment was at 8:30 a.m. then she went to school afterwards. She was excited to tell her class and teachers her big announcement. </p>
<p>The picture above is of Lai Lai waiting at the doctor's office for my appointment. When we told the girls we were having another baby, we told them we were going to go find out if it's a boy or girl that morning. The older two immediately said they wanted a brother. Then Lai Lai firmly said, "I don't like sisters! I want a brother." </p>
<p>They were all disappointed it was another girl. I was happy it was another girl. Nate was fine either way, but after finding out it was a girl he was a little sad thinking of all the stuff he wouldn't be able to do with a son. We are all good with another sister now. The girls keep mentioning that maybe the next kid will be a boy. Nope. This will be the last kid. 		</p>

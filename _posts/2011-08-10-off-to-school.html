<p>This is a new milestone for me. I let my oldest go to public school. Of course I wouldn't have it any other way because I think every child need that experience of going to school. But it's a bit scary when it's your first child and a daughter. Half of me can't believe I have this little girl who is old enough to go to kindergarten. But I know she is SO ready for school even though she will be the youngest in her class. She is mature and extremely smart. So she will do well. And it'll teach her a lot of things about life that she needs to learn - social skills, following instructions and just how the school system works.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to being an involved parent and helping out at the school whenever I can with two other children at home. And I look forward to this experience to be a mom of a school age child. Laney, unfortunately, will have to wait three years before she can go to kindergarten. That'll be rough on her because she loves to do everything Kenzie does.</p>
<p>Adjusting to school schedule has not been easy, especially since I'm not a morning person. Having to wake up at 5:30 every morning is not my cup of tea. We tried to hop on this new schedule a week before school began and that was rough on all of us. We were way off our old schedule during the summer. So jumping to an earlier school schedule was not easy. And of course Nate has been gone a lot since we've been back from Washington with church stuff. I think I'll just have to accept the fact that Nate will always be gone a lot with church and work. I thought it would be better once he was done with school but it hasn't really been that much better.</p>
<p>We attended the meet and greet the Friday prior to first day of school. There are a lot of kindergarteners in her school. There are 9 kindergarten teachers and they each have about 26 kids. There are 5 parapros who have to split their time with two teachers. There are 8 children from our ward in kindergarten with Kenzie, only one in her class. Kenzie's teacher is Mrs. DeLuca and she seemed really nice. One of Kenzie's friends had her last year.</p>
<p>The first day of school went much better than I thought. A few months ago, thinking about Kenzie going off to school brought me anxiety. But as the days got closer, I was so excited for her to start school. She was also excited. Laney wanted to be in school with Kenzie. Good thing she will have dance classes soon to keep her occupied at least once a week. On the first day we walked her into school and got her situated then walked right back out. Laney didn't seemed to be bothered by it. No one cried. Then Laney and I went shopping and ran errands for the next few hours. My mom came over to watch Laney while I went back to school to volunteer in her class. I helped the teacher cut a few things and with the children.</p>

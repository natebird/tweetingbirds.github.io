<ul>
<li>Kenzie can put on her Dora sandals on by herself. Most of the time, she even gets the left and right correct.</li>
<li>She likes the smell of things and sniffs everything. Kenzie especially loves to sniff Play Dough. </li>
<li>My brother, Jeffrey, gave her a Barney doll, which she loves just as much as her Baby Bop and Elmo doll. The three dolls do everything together with Kenzie.</li>
<li>Her new favorite game is playing catch with her favorite pink ball or a tennis ball. </li>
<li>Kenzie says our car, the Protege, is her car. When she notices it not in the garage, she says daddy is driving her car. </li>
<li>She loves The Little Mermaid and is even learning the words to some of the songs in the movie. She can tell you all the names of the characters in the movie. </li>
</ul>

Somehow, Disney princesses has crept their way into our house and made themselves at home. I feel like we live at Disneyland. Poor Nate, he is already out numbered by the amount of estrogen in the house (even more hormonal females coming shortly), he is now swimming in a house filled with the color pink and Disney princess EVERYWHERE.</p>
<p>Evidence:
<ul>
<li>Pink blankets, pillows, and sleeping bag.</li>
<li>A pink princess mirror hung on the wall.</li>
<li>A princess tent.</li>
<li>Disney movies playing on our TV.</li>
<li>Disney princess toys, coloring books, figurines, stickers throughout the house.</li>
<li>Disney in the kitchen - fridge magnets, cups, and other pink kitchen items.</li>
<li>Pink clothing items from head to toe, including undershirts, jackets, socks, shoes, underwear. </li>
<li>Pink anything - markers, crayons, paper, drawings, highlighter, toothbrush, stroller, chalk, etc.</li>
<li>Disney princess music playing from our computer and downstairs speakers - the same 10 songs over and over again.</li>
<li>Disney princess music videos playing on our computer from YouTube.</li>
<li>A 2-year-old going around the house singing "A Whole New World" word for word on repeat.</li>
<li>Disney princess songs playing on repeat in my car.</li>
<li>Any time we go somewhere, at least one Disney princess makes it out on the trip. </li>
<li>Any time we are at Wal-Mart or Target we have to visit the princess aisle. </li>
<li>Pink bicycles and helmets.</li>
<li>Nate and I trying to memorize Disney song lyrics to keep up with our little princess who knows all the words.</li>
<li>Play time is now pretending to wear glass slippers and dancing with a prince. </li>
<li>Disney princess figurines sleeping in the bed with Kenzie rather than Barney or Elmo. </li>
<li>Princess books being read every day. </li>
</ul>
<p>I didn't imagine myself being a princess mom and allowing Disney brand my house. But I totally got sucked into it with a 2-year-old who believes she is a direct descendent of Walt Disney. I do have my limits. I won't let her wear any Disney princess clothes unless its playing dress up or a Halloween costume. I'm not big into cartoon characters on shirts. I also won't make any permanent changes to our house such as changing carpet to pink or putting princesses wall decals on our walls.		</p>

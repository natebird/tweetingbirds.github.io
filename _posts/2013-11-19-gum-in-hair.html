<p>I haven't given my children gum yet. So one day Kenzie came home with a Blow Pop that she got from school. The one or two times before where she had a Blow Pop, she would suck on the lolly pop portion of the sucker then throw it away when she got to the gum. This time she decided to eat the gum too. And later that evening, she came to me and said, "Ouch! Mom, I have gum in my hair!" I asked her how she got gum in her hair and she said she put it behind her ear like Viola Beauregarde in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. Well, she learned her lesson when I had to cut the gum out of her hair. Luckily it was behind her ear where it wasn't very noticeable. Silly girl!		</p>

				Since becoming a mother of two, I often find myself wondering how other moms do it. When it was just Kenzie and I, we had time to do fun crafts, play pretend, attend play groups or play dates. I had time to clean, cook, keep an orderly house, find time for my hobbies, decorate the house, work on projects. Nate and I had time to talk, have fun, attend the temple once in a while, even go on dates once in a blue moon. </p>
<p>I had a set daily routine with Kenzie. We both work well with routines. Then our lovely Laney and Nate's schooling came into the mix and I haven't found a new routine that works for all of us. Hence the neglected blog, lost of fun times with the kids, deserted time with Nate, abandoned cleaning of the home, and disappeared much needed personal time, taking a long shower doesn't count. Moms with multiple children need more hours in their days, it's only fair. Or else the mommy guilt starts to eat us alive.</p>
<p>I couldn't take it any longer. Anyone who knows me well knows I have to have things orderly, organized, clean, and systemized. I function well with routines with some flexibility. I can handle change and last minute ordeals. I love taking on challenges. So today, I sat down my with new challenge and we came to an accord. </p>

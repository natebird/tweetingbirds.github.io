				Once again, we are hit with illnesses in our home, just a head cold but still not fun. It all began with Kenzie who passed it on to me by having a tea party. She served tea (water) out of a cup she drank out of. I thought my immune system was iron clad, but I guess I was wrong. Then I kindly gave my germs to Nate and Laney, not on purpose though. The two of them got it the least of all of us so far. The good thing is they are all taking naps and I get maybe an hour to myself… I don't even know what to do with myself.		</p>

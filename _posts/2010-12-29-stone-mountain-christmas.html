				We have membership to Stone Mountain and that's why we've been there so often this year. We love it there. It's not too far from us, about 40 minute drive there. And there's so much to do all year round. The kids love it there. We've had membership since June and we've been there about 6 times. We still haven't seen everything there yet.</p>
<p>This time we went with friends. They have lot of lights for Stone Mountain Christmas. And they have lots of shows and activities for everyone. We watched a part of The Polar Express in 4D. They kids loved that. There was a bubble guy outside that did cool tricks with bubbles. That was Laney's favorite. We also rode the train singing Christmas carols and saw lots of cool lights. And we ate a picnic dinner among the crowd of people there. Saw the parade with the snow angel and Mr. and Mrs. Clause and the Coca Cola polar bear. Then we ended the day in the play barn where the kids had a blast and didn't want to go home. It was so cold and getting really late and the kids had to wake up early the next morning for Christmas Eve breakfast that we decided not to stay for the snow angel and fireworks.</p>

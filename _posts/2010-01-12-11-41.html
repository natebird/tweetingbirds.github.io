				I woke up the other day. Looked at my kids. Don't know what happened. They are not little anymore.</p>

<p><b>Laney at 11 months…</b>
<ul>
<li>Folds her arms during prayer. Not on demand. Only when she sees others do it. She doesn't do anything on demand.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Started talking a bit later than Kenzie. Two weeks ago, she started saying ma ma more frequently and to get my attention. And yay! She said mom first. Kenzie said dad first. She also says da da.</li>
<li>Also around the same time she said ma ma, she started waving hello and good bye.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Loves to shred up toilet paper into tiny, miniscule pieces. She is super sneaky about getting in the bathroom. She will get in there when someone goes in to do their business or when someone forgets to close the bathroom door upon leaving it.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Doesn't like to listen to anyone when they tell her 'No'. To her, 'No! No!' means keep doing it until someone removes you from the scene. Or it can also mean, 'Go faster!' when she is unrolling the toilet paper or shredding it.</li>
<li>Loves to eat, especially crackers, peas, green beans, corn and cheese. Like her mom, a lover of cheese.</li>
<li>Follows Kenzie around and plays with whatever Kenzie is playing with. It drives Kenzie crazy.</li>
<li>Loves to watch me cook. Then she likes to imitate me cooking.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Loves to help out in the kitchen as in pull everything out of the cupboards and pantry and dishwasher.</li>
<li>Loves to get under the bathroom sinks, clean it out by putting everything on the floor.</li>
<li>Can sense when the dishwasher is open from across the room. Will show up at the dishwasher within seconds and loves to pull out all the utensils clean or dirty.</li>
<li>Favorite hang out place is under the dining room table and eats whatever people drop. See, we don't need a pet.</li>
<li>Loves for me to hold her. She even has a mommy-hold-me dance. She walks up to me. Grabs on to my pant legs. Stomps her feet. Tugs at my pant legs. Look up and give the pity me look.&nbsp; </li>
<li>Wears 12 month size clothes.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Cannot stop talking from the minute she wakes up until she is asleep at night.</li>
<li>Talks very mature, like a 5 year-old. Asks intriguing questions. Curious about everything around her.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Still loves Disney princesses, but is starting to find other interests. Like her favorite PBS show, <i>Dinosaur Train</i>.&nbsp;</li>
<li>LOVES being a Sunbeam in Primary. She talked about it for days before her first Sunday as a Sunbeam. "I want to be a Sunbeam like the other big girls in Primary."</li>
<li>Not just say, but uses more advanced words correctly in her everyday conversations… aching, hypothesis, precocious, diabolical (that one was a bit difficult to explain the definition to her) and punctual. She can also name a few dinosaurs.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Is more than half my height.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Fashion queen. Has a taste and sense of style. Her own style. It pretty much evolves around the color pink. Has to pick out her own clothes each day.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Only wears one dress to church. Her red traditional Chinese dress because it's her Mulan dress. Luckily, my mom gave her a pink one for Christmas because the red one was getting too short.</li>
<li>Wears 3T and 4T size clothes.</li>
<li>Has a special talent in memorization. She can memorize vividly songs, movies, dialogues, events, what we said, who gave her what, pretty much anything the first or second time of seeing or hearing it. When she watches a new show or listens to a new song, she repeats the words as they are saying it to help her memorize it. She also uses repetition.&nbsp;</li>
</ul>

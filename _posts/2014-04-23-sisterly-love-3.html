				Laney loves babies. So it's no surprise that she wants to hold Nora all the time. She is always talking to her and wanting to be around her all the time. I have to constantly remind her that if the baby is sleeping she needs to leave her alone. She is such a loving sister. </p>
<p>For Lai Lai, it took her a while to warm up to the new baby. Lai Lai wanted to be the baby in the family. She was pretty upset that she wasn't the baby. But now she is a big mom for Nora. She is concerned when Nora is crying. And she will ask to hold her sometimes. She loves to give her hugs and kisses before bed. Lai Lai and Nora will have lots of time together as Laney starts kindergarten in the fall. So they will have lots of time to be best friends.</p>
<p>Kenzie is at school most of the day, so she doesn't have much baby time. And then when she gets home she is doing homework, practicing piano, in dance class, in piano lesson, or having down time playing. So she doesn't do much with the baby. But every once in a while she will ask to hold Nora. </p>

<p>
				The girls will play while the boy is away. That would be Nate gone at the end of April and beginning of May for a work conference in Portland. And since he was already in that part of the country, he decided to go home to Washington that weekend of the conference which happened to be his birthday weekend. He was able to spend some alone time with his parents. And while he was away, the girls and I had fun. Kenzie still had school. Laney and Kenzie had dance that week. When the weekend came around, the kids and I pulled out the sleeping bags and had a movie night.</p>

				Kenzie loves to say prayers now. And when it is time to pray, she puts on her serious face, folds her arms, and tells everyone to be quiet by putting her finger up to her mouth and saying, "Shhhh!" Then she repeats the last word of my sentences in the prayer. But now, she tries to add in her own words blessing everyone she knows and grateful for everything. She also requires us to pray often throughout the day, mostly around meal times.</p>

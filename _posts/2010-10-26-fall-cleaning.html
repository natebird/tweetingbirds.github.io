<p>
				I am going through the girls' summer, fall and winter clothes to see what fits and what they need. This means our room looks like thisâ€¦</p>

<p>Can you believe that they still have more clothes than this? There are 4 other huge storage bins full of clothes that's not pictured here. I hope our future kids are girls because we have lots of girls clothes. It feels good to get rid of stuff though. I need to have a yard sale.		</p>

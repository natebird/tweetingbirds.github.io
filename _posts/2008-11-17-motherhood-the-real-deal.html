Things have been just a tad crazy around here lately. But I hope this post will help all the mothers out there feel good about themselves because we can't be Mary Poppins everyday.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">Today Kenzie ate…</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span></span><br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Breakfast:</span> a bowl of Cheerios and a banana.<br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Lunch:</span> peanut butter and cheese crackers, strawberry applesauce, banana crackers, a few bites of leftover mac & cheese, and a pack of freeze dried strawberries and banana.<br /><span style="font-style:italic;">Dinner:</span> a piece of Italian bread, banana, a couple of rice cakes (bite size), and drank some Russian tea (it's not actually tea and she calls it cupcake juice because it tastes like cupcakes to her).</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 102);"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">Today I hauled Kenzie with me to…</span></span><br />1. Wal-Mart - get more bananas and some avocados on sale for $0.79/ea.<br />2. Michael's - return some unused supplies leftover from the Relief Society Holiday Workshop.<br />3. Pediatrician - Kenzie had a last minute appointment (literally last minute because I set the appointment then had 10 minutes to get there for it).<br />4. Publix - fill her prescriptions and pick up some groceries on sale (I got a bunch of <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/09/second-best/">brand name dental floss</a> for $0.29/ea).</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 51, 0);">Today Kenzie…</span></span><br />1. Did not eat any of her meals at regular meal time because we were out and about for lunch and dinner. I'm glad Nate gave her the patience lecture when she was just two days old. She has the greatest patience dealing with her parents.<br />2. Received the news that she has bronchitis again, but this time it hasn't turned into an infection yet. She also has a cold that may be irritated by allergies.<br />3. Was in the greatest spirit being her cute and funny self even though she was sick and being hauled around everywhere by me.<br />4. Didn't get home until 7 p.m. and missed saying bye to daddy before he left for school.<br />5. Said, "Mommy, guess what?! It's daddy's night!" I had to break it to her that Nate was at school.<br />6. Weighed 26 pounds at the doctor's office with all her clothes, jacket, and shoes on.<br />7. Impressed her pediatrician by her use of language. He said she was cute, beautiful, sweet, and very smart.<br />8. Had her diaper changed only three times. Ooops.<br />9. Still talking about and saddened by how we lost her Ariel at church two weeks ago. "Someone took my Ariel at church."<br />10. Wanted to watch <span style="font-style:italic;">The Little Mermaid</span> for FHE again.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Today I…</span></span><br />1. Was on the phone talking to the nurses at the pediatrician office, to the billing people for my mom's medical bills, to the nurses at the <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2008/11/diabetic-pathetic/">diabetes education class</a>, to both my parents at separate times, and to Nate giving him updates on Kenzie's doctor visit.<br />2. Had to be home while the termite guy came to inspect our house for renewal of contract.<br />3. Went shopping with my mom and Kenzie earlier in the day.<br />4. Tried to get Kenzie to sniff her inhaler through a spacer without much of a success.<br />5. Spent $85 trying to heal Kenzie from her coughing spells.<br />6. Was home long enough between errands to pay some bills, update budget, and eat lunch at 2:30, then dinner at 7:15.<br />7. Had another spacey moment when I called to verify the time for the gestational diabetes class and found out it was 8 a.m. and not 8 p.m. Ooops, again.<br />8. Got to see Nate maybe a total of 2 hours today before going to bed. That's the saddest part.</p>
<p>OK, I promise there will be a happy and more uplifting post coming up soon.		</p>

				I had a 30 percent off coupon and a $10 Kohl's cash to use a few weeks ago. So I went shopping for something for myself. And what better thing to get for myself than shoes? I love shoes. So I checked out Kohl's shoe section. I had both girls with me. Laney is a shoe person like me. She is always in my closet going through my shoes and wearing my heels around the house. We are talking 4-inch heels. So when we were in the shoe department at Kohls of course it was heaven to this little shoe enthusiast girl. First thing she did was take off her shoes. Then headed straight for the shoe boxes on the shelves. Finally she pulled them out of the boxes and had them on her feet before you can even blink. She trotted around the store, near me, in heels and posing. The customers walking by thought it was the cutest thing they ever saw. They told the people they were with to come and see. It wasn't before long Laney had an audience amazed at her skill to trot around on stilettos and high heels.</p>
<p>When we got home, Laney wanted to know where the pink shoe box was. She insisted they were her shoes, not mommy's shoes. She had to show them off to Nate by wearing them around the house. She's one of those girls who would mop the kitchen floor in heels. Such a diva. Didn't have my camera with me, so enjoy these phone photos.</p>

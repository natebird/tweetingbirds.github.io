<p>She is so cute that you just have to love her no matter what she is doing or destroying. She never fails to impress you with her capabilities.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loves to play with babies. And she is good at taking care of them. She is going to be an excellent big sister.</li>
<li>A socialite. She loves to hang out and meet new people. She's great with kids older than her. She will go right up to them and join the group. She's not as interested in kids her age. And she has to say hi to everyone.</li>
<li>Is talking in 2-3 word sentences. Her vocabulary has grown a lot lately. It's just people have a hard time understanding her sometimes. She still needs to work on pronunciation.</li>
<li>Is a mommy's girl. She has to know where I am at all times and keep me within her sight. She loves to snuggle up with me and have me hold her. Even though she favors me now, I have a feeling she will be daddy's girl when she gets older. But until then, I'm savoring every moment of her love.</li>
<li>Very compassionate. She is concerned for those around her who are sad and/or crying. She will go ask them what's wrong or why they are crying. She likes to take care of people.</li>
<li>She is aware of who is missing. Every morning she comes into my room and immediately ask, "Where did Daddy go?" Or if Kenzie is missing she will ask where's Kenzie. She wants everyone to be together.</li>
<li>She wants to do everything Kenzie does. She follows her big sister. She loves to dress up, play with princesses and dance like Kenzie. They are each other's best friends and each other's worst enemies sometimes.</li>
<li>She doesn't take offense easily and gets back up when she is knocked down. She brushes things off and has a pretty chilled personality.</li>
<li>She also loves to play ball, play in water, get dirty, play with trains and cars. If this third baby is not a boy, Laney will be the closest thing to a boy for Nate. But she is also girly too. She's a nice mix.</li>
<li>She is spunky, spontaneous, lighthearted and an over-all fun personality. So not like the rest of us in the family but she's exactly what we need in our lives.</li>
<li>She is not very big into sweet food. She likes fruits, suckers, ice cream and fruit snacks. Other than that, she's pretty much a salty snacker. She doesn't like chocolate (ah, just like her mom. I love it), peanut butter, jelly, milkshakes, syrups, cookies and candies. She like's her food plain.</li>
<li>Her favorite phrase is "Umâ€¦ No thank you." She says that for everything except when Nate asks her if she wants to date boys or kiss boys. Then she responds with no hesitation, "Uh huh!" or "Yes!"</li>
</ul>

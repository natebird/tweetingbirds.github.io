<p>Happy anniversary to us! Yesterday was our anniversary hitting our 7 year mark. Couldn't have asked for a better husband to be by my side through this journey. I have been writing down our dating stories for <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/category/flashback-fridays/">Flashback Fridays</a> and it is incredible how we got together. Here's us at the temple where we started our life together forever. I love this guy. Looking for many more years together. Like eternity.</p>
<ul>
<li>I love that Nate is a hard worker and does so much to provide for our family. He is happiest when all of us are happy. He gives of himself so selflessly so his girls and wife can be happy. And he never cares about receiving credit or recognition for what he does for us or anyone.</li>
<li>I love that Nate is so willing to serve. He loves to help others and serve whenever he can. And he is often asked to do things through the church or family and he does so without a second thought.</li>
<li>I love that Nate helps out around the house with cleaning and cooking. He doesn't do the cooking as often as the cleaning. But he cooked meals whenever I'm am nauseated with pregnancy (which usually lasts about 4 months for me) and every once in a while Â when I'm tired of cooking.</li>
<li>I love that Nate is a worthy priesthood holder and is faithful in the church. And that we both believe in the same religion. That is so important to me.</li>
<li>I love that Nate loves to spend time with me. And he also likes to spend time with the girls. He purposefully work jobs that doesn't require him to travel often because he likes to be with us.</li>
<li>I love that Nate is the calm one but takes charge when he needs to.</li>
<li>I love that Nate listens to me. I love talking to him about everything.</li>
<li>I love that Nate helps me make decisions. Big decision or even little ones like what size shoes to get the kids. I like to have his input in decisions.</li>
<li>I love that Nate deals so well with my OCD tendencies. It's not that bad, but there are certain things that puts my mind at ease and he happily does it. Like helping the kids wash their hands when they come in the house.</li>
<li>I love that Nate loves to do yard work and handy-man work around the house because I hate doing yard work.</li>
<li>I love that Nate knows how to fix and do a lot of things around the house (install ceiling fans, change fluids in the car, change car breaks, fix the dishwasher, etc.). And if he doesn't, he will learn how to do it. Just like his dad.</li>
<li>I love that Nate is such a good father for little girls. He is incredible with them. I love watching him interact with our children. The girls just absolutely adores him. He even learned all about princesses and Disney princess songs for them.</li>
<li>I love that Nate doesn't look at me like I'm crazy when I tell him ideas I have in my head. And he helps me figure out how to make my ideas come to life. For example, the girls' bedroom. He spent hours and weeks painting over 100 stripes on the girls' bedroom walls because I had a vision in my head.</li>
<li>I love that Nate keeps in contact with his parents and siblings often. Like several times a week. He is such a family man.</li>
<li>I love that Nate loves my family. We are surrounded by my family, so it's nice that he gets along so well with them. In fact, many of my family members love him more than me!</li>
<li>I love that Nate is supportive of my endeavors and desires to learn and try new things. I love learning new skills and he is supportive of me learning them. He encourages me and listens to me talk endlessly about it. And he even provide time for me to do it.</li>
<li>I love that Nate thinks it is important that I have time to myself. He encourages me to go out with friends, go to church events and do things without the kids. Much needed for stay-at-home moms.</li>
<li> I love that Nate doesn't think of being home with the kids as babysitting. And I can leave him with the kids with absolutely no instructions and pre-made meals. I know he will have things taken care of when I return home. Many times, the house is cleaner and the kids are happier when I get home.</li>
<li>I love that Nate loves to be challenged. He is not lazy in any way. He loves to do things that are challenging to keep him on his toes.</li>
<li>I love that Nate is a saver (money-wise). It makes our family finances so much easier that we are both savers.</li>
</ul>

<p>
				The girls had their last dance class a couple Saturdays ago. I put them in a 5 week dance class through the summer to give them something to do and to try Laney out for her first dance class to determine whether I would put her in a dance class for the fall. Well, of course both girls loved dance class. Laney especially. Every morning she would wake up and asked if it was dance class day. She would really love to be in a ballet/tap class, but for her age, all the classes are only a 30 minute ballet. Totally understandable for children their age.</p>
<p>Laney was so good at following her teacher Ms. Virginia and did such a great job learning fundamental dance moves. Kenzie's class was OK. I don't think she learned anything new. It mostly helped her practice her fundamentals in tap and ballet. Both girls are signed up for next year. Laney will continue to take the bitsy ballet class that's 30 minutes of ballet with a recital at the end of the year. Kenzie will take the new VIVID class where she learns ballet/tap/hip hop in an hour class. This will be her first time learning hip hop. I think she'll like it and she has a couple friends in the same class. And at the end of the year recital she will do three numbers, one for each style of dance.</p>

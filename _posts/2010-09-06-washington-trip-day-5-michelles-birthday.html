<p>One of the best things about being home is the food. Cyndi is a great cook and her house is always loaded with food. It's funny because when they say, "It's in the fridge." Someone always respond with, "Which one? The one in the kitchen, the pantry or the one in the garage?" Not to mention there is a mini fridge in Randy's shop too. That's the difference between my family and Nate's family. I come from a family of 4. Nate grew up with a family of 10 where they would go through a gallon of milk just at breakfast. Should I also mention that his family is full of 10 extremely tall people who can eat? Nate's mom and I are the shortest in the family at 5'6". The tallest? One of the twins at around 6'6".</p>

<p>Friday was more water time for the girls. First they played in the kiddie pool and in the sandbox in the backyard.</p>

<p>Then I ran errands with Cyndi while Nate stayed home while the girls napped. After running around town, we all went swimming at the neighbor's pool. Randy and Cyndi has a neighbor who has an awesome salt water pool. And they told them to come and swim anytime. And they mean it. So we took the girls over and they loved swimming like mermaids. I taught Laney to jump into the pool as I caught her. Kenzie would only do it from the sitting position.</p>

<p>That evening we celebrated Michelle's birthday. Michelle is the youngest and just turned 19. She was going to be in Provo on her birthday so we did an early celebration. She is starting her sophomore year at BYU.</p>

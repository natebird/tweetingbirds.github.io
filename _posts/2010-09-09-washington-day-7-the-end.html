<p>Sunday rolled around and it was sad to know that we were leaving the next day. The girls loved being with grandma and grandpa and all their aunts and uncles. And we've all enjoyed some delicious home cooking by Cyndi. We stayed up each night to talk all night long. We watched movies and played games. Those who were musical played music.</p>

<p>Church was at 1:30 p.m. So before church, each of the Bird children received a father's blessing from Randy. It was a tender and spiritual moment for us all. Church was great. I enjoyed going to Relief Society for the first time in 3 1/2 years. Randy was released from his calling in the bishopric an called by the stake to be the High Priest Group Leader. The funny thing about that was my dad was called to be a counselor in the bishopric 2 1/2 years ago. Six months later, Randy was called to be a counselor in the bishopric too. Then the Sunday before we left for Washington, my dad was released from the bishopric and called as the High Priest Group Leader. A Sunday later, the exact same thing happened to Randy. My dad and Randy are so in sync.</p>

<p>After church, Laney helped out in the kitchen by climbing up on the counter and eating pasta out of the pot. She just helped herself. The pot was cooled, luckily. Just look at her got at it.</p>

<p>Cyndi made a special Sunday dinner and we all sat around the same dining room table and enjoyed our last night together.</p>

<p>Nate's parents are already planning for a Bird reunion next year. The last time all eight siblings were together was at our wedding six years ago. Next summer, the twins will be back from their missions and hopefully everyone will be able to make it.		</p>

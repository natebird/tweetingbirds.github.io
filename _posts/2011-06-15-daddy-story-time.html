<p>The girls love spending time with Nate. And the other week, we had gone to the thrift store and found new books for $0.50. One of the books being "Dreams Under the Sea" a Disney book about Ariel pretending to marry Prince Eric, the statue. Nate started reading the book to the girls and once he realized what the book was about, he said, "Why am I reading this book? This is a horrible book. Don't get any ideas girls." Of course Kenzie loves the book because it is about weddings.		</p>

<p>I am working hard on my list of things I want to do before I turn 30. This past weekend I was able to cross off two things on the list. Saturday we had friends watch our girls (we traded family photos for babysitting) while Nate and I went out to dinner. We went to a sushi restaurant. I love sushi and would eat it every day if I could. But since I don't eat sushi while pregnant or nursing, that doesn't leave much time in between. I have been craving sushi for years. I finally got it! It was nice to be on a date with Nate. Afterwards we ran errands, shopped around. Then we picked up our kids, put them to bed and had friends over for game night. They had left their kids with a babysitter. We finally played Puerto Rico, a game I got Nate for Christmas last year. Great times.</p>

<p>
				I am not a pet person. It's mostly because I think animals are dirty. And why would I want to spend the money and energy to raise and maintain a pet when I have kids to take care of? Every time I see ads for pet foods in the paper I am so grateful that I don't have a pet. And any time we leave the house for vacations or trips I am so glad I don't have to find pet sitters or do a drop off at animal daycare.</p>
<p>I do feel bad sometimes about not being a pet person because Laney is such a lover of animals. Anytime she sees a dog she wants to play with it. And she loves and plays with a little beanie dog that she got from one of the sisters I visit teach for Christmas last year. She treats it like a real dog.</p>
<p>And Kenzie unfortunately had a different ideas about tooâ€¦</p>
<p>Kenzie: I want a hamster.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Why would you want a hamster?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Because they are cute.</p>
<p>Tiffany: I think they look like rats. And they are gross.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Dudepa [my dad] told me they are cute. And they are small. That's all I know about hamsters.		</p>

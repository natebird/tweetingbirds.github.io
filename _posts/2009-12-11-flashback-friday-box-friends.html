<p>Going back through our photo library trying to find other pictures of Kenzie in the box, I couldn't find them. Instead, I found this picture of Kenzie and her friend Hailey in a box. Look how little they were! Hailey is Kenzie's birthday buddy. Same birthday, a year apart. This was back, October of 2007. I placed the car seat box in the playroom for Kenzie to play with. Hailey thought it would be fun to stand it up, get in it and have the adults throw ball pit balls at them. The girls laughed for hours. </p>
<p>Hailey has since moved out of state and Kenzie misses her dearly. Maybe Hailey's parents could send her here in a box. </p>

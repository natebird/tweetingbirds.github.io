<p>
				I love this girl. She is her own person. She knows what she wants and she knows how to get it. We bud heads sometimes because she is so strong willed but she still loves being mommy's girl. She's at that age where she has a hard time sharing with others. Very possessive of her things. But overall, she is just a cutie who will melt your heart.</p>

<p>This is Super Hero Lai Lai. She wears her pajamas with just her arms in.</p>

<p>On Mondays we go to Kenzie's class to help out her teach with various things. Every time we go in she give Kenzie a hug. She loves seeing her sister at school.</p>

<p>She is warming up to dad now. She will at least let him change her diaper and snuggle with him sometime.</p>

<p>She tried new dance moves and loves to dance like her big sisters. She will probably start dance when she is 3, next August. She hasn't be begging to do dance class like Laney was at her age. But she does love to dance.</p>

<p>She throws some hard core tantrums some times. This time she was supposed to go upstairs to get ready for bed but she wanted to finish building her Legos. So she cried and fought her dad until she just came downstairs by herself and finished it up. Then she was fine after that.</p>

				Yes. A lot of changes happening here with Nate. He starts a new job and now he has a new calling. He received a phone call from the stake last week with one of the counselors of the stake presidency wanting to meet with the both of us. Yikes. We pretty much knew it was Nate who was getting a new calling. So this past Sunday Nate was released as the Young Men president and called as the ward executive secretary. He has had this calling before with our last bishop. So we know what to expect. It's nice because it should take less time than YM president. He was sad to not be working with the YM anymore. He only had that calling for 10 months. But he's excited to be working with the bishop and bishopric.		</p>

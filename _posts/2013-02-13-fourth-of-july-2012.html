				Last Fourth of July a bunch of our friends got together to watch fireworks at a shopping center in our town. They do a big fireworks there every year and it gets pretty packed. My parents came along and our girls loved having them there. We were also there with five other families. I wasn't sure how our girls would do staying up watching fireworks after their usual bedtime, especially Lai Lai, but they did great. The fireworks were lovely and the company was also great. Missing Barron right now after seeing these pictures.</p>

<p>
				Laney went in for her 2 year wellness check and she's a nice healthy child. She is almost 26 pounds (25 percentile) and 34 1/4" (75 percentile) and her head is in the 90th percentile for her head circumference. Ha. She's got a huge cranium. And she just had one booster shot for her immunization. She did so well. She let the doctor check her without making a fuss like the other previous checkups.</p>
<p>Kenzie spoke the most to the doctor at Laney's checkup. She was quite the chatter mouth. The doctor was very nice about it.</p>
<p>Laney is becoming quite the talker too. She is starting to put 2-3 words together for a sentence. She is still very attached to mom. I don't mind too much.		</p>

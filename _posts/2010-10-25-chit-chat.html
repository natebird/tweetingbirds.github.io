<p>Laney all of a sudden is talking a lot more now. She still needs to work on her pronunciation, but Nate and I can understand what she says most of the time.</p>
<ul>
<li>Laney</li>
<li>and beyond! (From Toy Story - "To infinity and beyond.")</li>
<li>mouth</li>
<li>Dude Dude (instead of Dudepa, which is what they call my dad)</li>
<li>rock</li>
<li>cracker</li>
<li>kitty (her favorite Hello Kitty doll)</li>
<li>blanket</li>
<li>what?!</li>
<li>sure</li>
<li>yes</li>
<li>see</li>
<li>down</li>
<li>baby</li>
<li>oh no!</li>
</ul>
<p>Laney's learningâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li>Location of eyes, ears, mouth and nose.</li>
<li>She is into Disney princesses too. She can sing two songs and they are both princesses. Ariel's song (Ah, ah, ah.) and Sleeping Beauty ("I know you, I've walked with you once upon a dream.")</li>
<li>She likes to dump water out and drink it off things (tables, carpet, floor, counters, etc.).</li>
<li>She loves to wear shoes inside the house. She loves to wear Kenzie's shoes and my shoes. She loves shoes. But as soon as we put her in the car seat in the car, she takes off her shoes.</li>
<li>She hates wearing socks and pajamas with footsies.</li>
<li>She gives the best looks with her eyes.</li>
<li>She eats the food Kenzie doesn't eat. Kenzie and Laney put together eat the meal of one person.</li>
</ul>

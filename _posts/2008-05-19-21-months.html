				Kenzie is quickly approaching her 2nd birthday, and I am totally not ready yet! I want her to stay this age forever because she brings such a happy spirit into our home. Every day she is full of surprises and funny moments. Her communication skills are soaring with a desire to learn more each day. I love being home with her and can't imagine missing these precious moments at a time when she is growing up much too quickly for my liking.
<ul>
<li>She uses another, and, and too, properly in sentences.</li>
<li>She says 2-3 word sentences. </li>
<li>She has learned to ask for help when she can't do something herself (open doors, get something out of her reach, opening the refrigerator, etc.).</li>
<li>She says her own prayers or help us say our prayers by contributing making sure we bless everyone she knows. </li>
<li>She knows most of the Winnie the Pooh and Sesame Street characters without watching the shows.</li>
<li>She tells me when she is poopy or wet and wants her diaper changed. Lately, she has been telling me "Pooping," as she is doing it. And if we are at home, after she is done, she will take off her pants/shorts, and tell me, "Change diaper." Then, she goes to the little cabinet at our entertainment center and proceeds to get a clean diaper, get out the wipes, and diaper cream (even if she doesn't need it), and the diaper changing pad (even though we haven't been using it for the last year). She sets everything up and lays herself down on top of the diaper changing pad with her legs up in the air. She will even try to take off her dirty diaper and try to put the clean one under her. She even tries self wipe and loves to apply diaper cream on her bum, just can't manage to reach that far. We're getting closer to potty training!</li>
<li>She knows and can read all the capital letters in the alphabet. We are working on lower case letters and saying them in order. </li>

<li>She says her numbers, "1, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10." We're working on 2 and 4. She knows them, just skips them when counting. I am also teaching her to read numbers. </li>
<li>I am grateful that she still takes a 2-3 hour nap each day at 2 p.m. There are times when she's tired enough that she'll just start heading upstairs to her bed with her blanket and Baby Bop around 2 p.m. </li>
<li>She has amazing memory where she remembers events from days ago, names and faces of people she meets, where things go, what she did in nursery, and so forth.</li>
<li>She loves to paint and play with Play Doughâ€¦ it has become a daily ritual.  In the picture below, she is accessorizing with Play Dough bracelets and anklets. </li>

<li>Her favorite dolls are Baby Bop and Elmo, in that order. She got both on our Utah trip.</li>
<li>Her favorite color is white, although when you ask her what her favorite color is, she'll say something else. But her favorite color is white because when we play with Play Dough, she wants to use the white one all the time. Then when we're outside doing chalk, she uses white most often. And she is always asking me to refill her white paint on her paint tray. </li>
<li>She can identify the colors orange, purple, blue, red, pink, black, gray, brown, white, yellow, and green. </li>
<li>She is <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;">very</span> good at helping me clean up and picking up after herself. There are times when I find her putting things away after she was done playing with it. </li>
<li>She can put her shoes on herself, even on the right sides. She can't do the straps yet. </li>

<li>She is liking nursery more. Still cries the first few minutes in there, but she enjoys being with friends. </li>
<li>She has moved on to wearing size 24 months clothes. Although, the bottoms on the 24 months are still quite big on her. She doesn't have hips or a bum to hold it up either. In fact, I pulled out her 9-12 months pants from the attic and she is wearing them as shorts for the summer. She's tall and skinny, about 24 pounds with clothes and diaper on. </li>
<li>She loves music and dancing. She sings "Baa, Baa, Black Sheep," "Ring Around the Rosy," "Twinkle Twinkle Little Stars," the alphabet song up to G, and the birthday song. She also loves dancing to, "Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes," "If You're Happy and You Know It," "The Library Boogie," "The Itsy Bitsy Spider," and "The Hockey Pokey."</li>
<li>She still loves to help mommy cook. I let her pour ingredients into a mixing bowl and stir.</li>
<li>For some reason, she likes to open all the drawers in the kitchen. Luckily for me, it's not a daily thing, just every once in a weird while. </li>

<li>My mom has taught her body parts and numbers in Mandarin. She understands more than she can speak. And my mom is the only one who can get her to say things in Mandarin, believe me, I've tried. Kenzie can repeat words in Mandarin when my mom speaks to her in Mandarin. </li>
<li>My mom is also teaching her to use the chopsticks. She was able to get a few bites in her mouth. </li>

<ul>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">5:30 p.m.:</span></span> Outside temperature reached <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">90 degrees</span>, both a sunny and beautiful day.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:07 p.m.:</span></span> I called Nate asking him when he would be home from work since I was making breakfast for dinner and would like to have all the food hot and ready by the time he got home. He told me he was leaving the office and would be home in about 15 minutes.</li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:15 p.m.:</span></span> It began to thunder loudly as lightning flashed every 5 minutes or so. Then the down pour of heavy rain as it drenched the ground. And I began to worry about Nate driving through the storm safely. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:22 p.m.:</span></span> Nate arrived home soundly! Hurray! I never heard the garage door open because the rain and thunder banged so loudly outside. And the tornado sirens rang through the neighborhood. Kenzie freaked a little with all the "noise outside." I finished cooking the hash browns and worked on the grits.  </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:27 p.m.:</span></span> The power flickered on and off for about 15 minutes, then finally died. It left us unable to stay up-to-date with the weather on TV. The tornado sirens still sang its tunes of warning. And the outside temperature dropped down to <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">65 degrees</span>. Kenzie was glad to see her daddy home and wanted to be held by someone as she held on to her blanket and Baby Bob and Elmo. I cooked the grits just in time for the power to go off, leaving the scrambled eggs uncooked and still in the refrigerator. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:30 p.m.:</span></span> The craziness began with dime sized hail hitting our house so hard that it shook our garage door and made the windows sound like it was going to crack. The thick merciless wind made the hail came down full force. We closed some of the blinds in the house just in case the windows did shatter, it wouldn't get all over the place. Thunder and lightning still threatened our house as it roared right on top of us. Kenzie felt uneasy and would not let go of mom or dad in need of security and comfort. I began to wonder what our house insurance covered. </li>

<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:37 p.m.:</span></span> I decided to risk it and opened the refrigerator to get out the fruit, milk, and eggs to finish making the rest of dinner, with the encouragement of Nate who wanted scrambled eggs with his meal. Even without power, I scrambled up some eggs on our gas stove by using a lighter. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:50 p.m.:</span></span> We ate a candle lit breakfast for dinner and listened to the harmony of the storm. We also prayed for safety as we blessed the food.  </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">6:56 p.m.:</span></span> Hail ceased but the thunder and lightning continued. Our yard was white covered in hail. Our yard on the side of our house was a bit flooded. Our backyard had a little flood and hail damage. And the fact that I have been getting on to Nate about cleaning out our gutters didn't provide the proper drainage of our roof to the ground. And leaves forced off trees covered the yard, plastered windows, and blanketed the roof. The tornado sirens silenced. </li>

<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">7:25 p.m.:</span></span> We cleaned up dinner, and Kenzie wanted to play with Play Dough by the windows. It actually got brighter as the storm passed, however, fog quickly settled in. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">8:05 p.m.:</span></span> Nate decided to take Kenzie to Blockbuster just up the street to rent "National Treasure: The Book of Secrets." He had to manually open the garage door opener since power was still off. While they were gone, I looked through catalogs and magazines in attempt to decided on paint colors for the interior of the house. Don't get too excited, this was my forth or fifth attempt. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">8:21 p.m.:</span></span> Nate called saying Blockbuster was out of "National Treasure" and asked if I had alternative preferences. As Nate talked, I heard Kenzie said in<br />
 the background, "Barney movie!" </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">8:30 p.m.:</span></span> The storm passed and moved its damaging spirit northeast. Nate returned home empty handed and Kenzie came home excited to show me her new "blue ball," a.k.a. a gum ball from the gum ball machines. We told her it was a blue ball so she wouldn't eat it. It was too hard and too much of a choking hazard. Therefore, she spent the rest of the evening throwing the gum ball on the floor hoping it would bounce like a bouncy ball. No luck. Horrible parents. </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">9:00 p.m.:</span></span> Still without power, we watched the sunset turned the sky pink and the dark clouds cleared. Nate decided he would go out and rake up some of the leaves left by the storm. Kenzie and I spent some time reading books using a flashlight. She also had a great time as she played with the flashlight, pointing it to the ceiling and called the bright spot, "sun." </li>
<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">9:30 p.m.:</span></span> Power back on, so grateful it didn't take 19 hours like it did last time. Much past Kenzie's bedtime, we put her to bed safely. </li>
</ul>

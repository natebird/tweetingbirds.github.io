				Although we had a great trip out to Washington, it was nice to come home again. We traveled home on Thursday because it was the cheapest day to fly back. We spent the night in Seattle in a hotel near the airport so we can fly out at 9 a.m. the next day. Lai Lai slept on the makeshift bed on the floor in the hotel room under the desk. We've got so many kids now! And the flight back was pretty good. Even though we left early, we still didn't get back to Georgia until 9 p.m. EST. We had a 4.5 hour layover in Denver where it was snowing. Luckily the Denver airport had moving walkways that kept the kids entertained for a couple hours. And the kids were all good on both legs of the flight. We kept them entertained with Frozen and other movies on the iPad. </p>
<p>But then on the way home, Kenzie threw up in the car. We had stayed away from illness the whole time on our trip even though everyone else were getting sick. The next day we kept her isolated just in case she had a stomach flu. But she just over ate and from the stress of traveling because she was fine after throwing up that one time. But we had quite the mess to clean up in the van. </p>
<p>When we got home we it took us a couple weeks to catch up on stuff. We had some food that went bad in the house because we left last minute and we ended up staying a week longer than we had originally anticipated. Not only did we had to catch up but we also jumped right back into stuff that were already on our calendar - doctor appointments for me and the kids that were supposed to happen while we were gone but reschedule for when we got back. Catch up on some things we were trying to get done before our trip, like exchanged a dresser, getting our cars serviced. School stuff, church stuff, meetings, and tons of other stuff. I went to church the Sunday before Nora was born. I went to church once before we went to Washington. From Feb. 17 to April 12 I had been to church one time. It was nice to get back into life again!</p>
<p>Now we are gearing up for end of the year stuff. We are doing dance competition, dance recital, end of school year events, registering Laney for kindergarten, doing a bunch of stuff for my calling, birthdays, and anniversary. I can't wait until summer break! We are going to the beach the last week of school. Nate's mom will be coming with us. It'll be so much fun. And Nate's sister, Natalie, found out the day we were all flying into Washington that they will be moving to Georgia for John's residency. He got accepted to the Emory's residency program for psychiatry. They will be living here the next four years. We are super excited. </p>

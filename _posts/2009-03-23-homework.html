Last week she got her magnetic toy out of her church bag and placed the characters in a row on the steps of our stairs. When asked what she was doing, she said, "I'm busy doing my homework." She also says she wants to go to school to do her homework. She will be getting straight A's in school like her mommy.		</p>

				This one is for my brother, Jeffreyâ€¦</p>
<p>Side note: We borrowed the VHS Snow White movie from our library and it played fine until the very end when the Prince kissed Snow White. Kenzie freaked out about not being able to see the Prince carry Snow White away to the castle and live happily ever after. This happened months ago and she is still upset about it to this day.</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold;">Tiffany:</span> The Snow White movie we borrowed from the library was broken, huh?<br /><span style="font-weight:bold;">Kenzie:</span> Yeah, the Snow White movie was broken. That means we need tape to fix it.</p>
<p>My brother uses tape to fix everything. It must be genetic.		</p>

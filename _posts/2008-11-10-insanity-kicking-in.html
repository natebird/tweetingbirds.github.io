				Yes, so much going on in my life right now that I am unable to blog… isn't that everyone's story?! I even forgot last week's Flashback Friday. I don't want my blog to be a place where I complain or vent about all that's going on right now, however, I do want to keep a record of all the craziness in our lives. I tried to add some pictures for your enjoyment. So here I go, bullet point style…
<ul>
<li>Last Wednesday I took my glucose test and failed by a hair. That's not good news for me since I will have to take the 3-4 hour test this Thursday. I hate needles and the nurses always have a difficult time getting blood out of me because I have extremely thin, wiggly veins. With the test on Thursday, they will have to draw blood every hour for 3-4 hours! While on the subject of pregnancy, I'm already in my last trimester! </li>
<li>Kenzie and I trekked over to my parents' house last Thursday (it's really not that far, about 35 minutes). We were able to spend some time with my family, I took my mom to her radiation treatment, and then we did some crafts together. Kenzie loves going over to my parents' house because they have all sorts of exciting toys for her to play with over there. This is my mom and Kenzie playing in the tent house.</li>

<li>Friday, I ran errands all day for me, Nate, and church. Then we had dinner at friends' house. It was nice to spend time with friends since we haven't had as much time to do that lately. Kenzie has been so great letting me tow her around with me all day, getting in and out of the car, hopping from place to place, missing naps, and going to bed late for the last few weeks. Here's a picture I snagged of her when we were in a store. She found sunglasses, put them on then said, "Mom, look at me!"</li>

<li>I am loving the fall colors. The drive to and from our neighborhood is just amazing. </li>

<li>We had a special stake conference with Elder Snow from the Seventy visiting. I really enjoyed it. He talked about making time for the family and providing gospel principle learning opportunities for children. For the last three Sundays, Kenzie has been wearing the same yellow dress to church. She refuses to wear any other dress. She puts on the dress and says, "Mommy, I'm Belle!" (from Beauty and the Beast). Here's Nate and Kenzie all ready for church, she's wearing the yellow dress since you can't tell.</li>

<li><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-style: italic;">Nate has been busy with school</span> is an understatement. He has been swamped with midterms, case studies, group projects, and other assignments. He has been let go from his job and began his first day working from home full-time on his side business today. He is hoping to get that going by the beginning of December. He will be doing that while applying for other jobs. We're praying he will hear back from any of the companies soon. We set up a little office for him in our room so he can work from home with the door closed, less distraction from Kenzie. Here's Nate in his new office (he wanted a stand up desk, but this was the cheaper solution).</li>

<li>I have been running around going crazy purchasing supplies for the Relief Society Holiday Workshop craft that I am in charge of teaching, the tile boards. In the beginning, I was just hoping that maybe 12 people would sign up so it would be worth my time. But as the weeks went by, more than 12 people signed up and they signed up to make several tile boards. I think the count is up to 92 now! So I have been making several trips to many craft stores buying out the glaze and waiting for them to restock to buy out their supplies again. Then there are the other materials I have been collecting over the last few weeks to make sure I have enough for everyone. I hope everything works out at the workshop this Saturday as I will be spending pretty much the whole day helping people make their tiles. </li>
<li>Kenzie and I had a great time making a quick birthday cake for my mom. My mom is not a big cake person, but Kenzie insisted on making a cake for her so she can blow out candles. It was wonderful celebrating her birthday as she is an amazing person and an example to all of us of strength through trials. She is on her last week of chemo and radiation treatments. Yay! Then she'll find out from the doctors what surgeries and other steps are necessary to make her cancer free. Doesn't she look great, especially after a full month of treatments?!</li>

<li>I am planning a potty party as a potty training kickoff for Kenzie to get her excited about it. I have also been reading potty training books to assist in this endeavor. I am hoping to get her out of diapers before Laney makes her arrival. Less diapers to purchase. I'm sure I'll be making a post about that soon. The kickoff is scheduled for next Monday. </li>
<li>With all the craziness, I have been neglecting my house. If I am not going anywhere for the day, I try to catch up on my emails, some household chores, blogging, and reading other people's blogs. Here is Kenzie helping me sweep. She is such a good helper!</li>

<li>YW has slowed down a bit since YW in Excellence. I did have to chaperone the youth dance last Saturday, taking me away from my hubby. :( Kenzie and Nate has been so patient as they wait for me while I attend meetings after church each Sunday (BYC, class presidency, missionary, etc.). </li>
<li>Lately, Kenzie has been sensitive with the clothes she wears. Majority of the time, she will only wear pink everything (socks, shoes, pants, shirts, jacket, pajamas, Halloween costume). It takes a lot of coaxing and convincing to get her to wear any other color. The only exception is her yellow dress on Sundays. She has turned pinkalicious. </li>
</ul>

				Can we say life doesn't get any easier? And it definitely never slows down. Probably why I'm wishing I was on some kind of tropical vacation right now. Or just toss my calendar into the abyss and forget everything I am supposed to be doing. Umâ€¦ yeah. I thought this year would be a little calmer than last. I mean, Nate has a steady job. He's not in school any more. But yeah. That didn't work out.</p>
<p>First of all, I got pregnant and it's been a little tough. I haven't been as sick as when I was pregnant with Kenzie. It was a lot worst in December and January. February got slightly better. Been extremely tired from the beginning. Absolutely no energy to do anything, even chase after the kids. I also smell EVERYTHING. It's horrible because smells makes me sick. It's mostly the sense of nausea. Then I got sick with a head cold a few weeks ago. Took me about a week to recover. Then this past Sunday I caught a stomach bug that Laney had. That had me in bed all day Sunday. And weak and depleted on Monday. Nate was so good to take care of me whenever he is home. It's those times when he's away at work or church that is hard on me.</p>
<p>Second, Nate's calling, my callings and our new assignment can be overwhelming. We are the cultural specialist for the Atlanta Temple Open House event for the youth. There's only two months to get it all prepared and the youth ready to perform. So we're being swarmed with emails and people with questions. And our ward also have lots of stuff going on with activities, events, fundraisers and such where every one of our weekends is jam packed.</p>
<p>Third, family and friends. To add to church things we have family and church events that double books our weekends.</p>
<p>Nate and I are learning to say no and set our priorities straight. And I probably sound like I am complaining right now but we have been blessed in ways to serve, a great family and wonderful friends who keep supporting us. So there's nothing else to do but to keep going on.		</p>

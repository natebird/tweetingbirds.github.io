<li>to cook with her set of pots and pans and the ones in mommy's kitchen.</li>
<li>to clean by putting things away, wiping the floors in the kitchen, and organizing things in order.</li>
<li>to yell out words she knows when others are speaking. When someone on TV or when we are talking or saying a prayer, she will yell out words she hear us saying such as Mama, Daddy, baby, read, go, happy, hopping, girl, up, rain, cool, book, and many more.</li>
<li>to change the diaper on her baby, kitty, and any other stuffed animal.</li>
<li>to read books. She pretends to say words and sometimes sings her version of ABC while pointing to words on the pages.</li>
<li>to watch Super Why, her favorite TV show that teaches her to read and sing the alphabet.</li>
<li>talk on mommy's cellphone with it tucked under her shoulder. She blabbers on like her mom.</li>
<li>to eat all fruits but especially strawberries. She is the only person I know who gets her daily fix of fruits each day, bananas, pineapple, peaches, apples, clementines, grapes, passion fruit, guava, mango, and papaya (the last 4 in the form of yogurt).</li>
<li>to draw pictures with crayons, or on her Doodle Pro. </li>
<li>to dance. We still have our dance time each day.</li>
<li>anything technology, definitely gets it from her father. She knows how to use Nate's iPhone, our iPods, our computer, the TV remote, push buttons on the Nintendo 64 controllers (we still play the 64), and take pictures with our camera. She likes to type, click on the mouse, and push buttons. Many times she has found new things these gadgets could do that we didn't even know about. </li>

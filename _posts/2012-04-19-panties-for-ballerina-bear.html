<p>It took a while for Laney to get the pooping down while she was potty training. It hurt a little and so she was afraid to push it out (sorry for being so graphic). We made a deal, if she went poopy in the toilet and filled her chart then she got to get panties for Ballerina Bear (her bear from Build-A-Bear Workshop). By December of last year she got it down. So I took her to Build-A-Bear to pick out panties for her bear. It was so cute. It had a little hole on the back of the panties for their little tail. And we got her bear some ballet slippers. However, going in there, Laney saw all the other cute outfits and accessories for bears. She wanted them all. I was not going to be one of those moms who caved in to buying her whatever she wanted because she was throwing a tantrum at the store. We walked out of there with only what we came in for.</p>
<p>Now Laney for the most part is potty trained through the night too. She still wets her bed every once in a while. I'm not quite sure how to motivate her to get up and go potty. She is just too lazy to get up to go to the bathroom. At first, she would get up and go. But now she's just lazy. She wakes up but then goes back to sleep then eventually wets the bed. It's hard to motivate someone who has a "I don't care" attitude.</p>

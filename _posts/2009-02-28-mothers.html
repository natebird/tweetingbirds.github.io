				While planning Sunday's YW lesson on Attitudes about Our Divine Roles, I came across this quote by Elder Jeffrey R. Holland.</p>
<p>"Mothers, we acknowledge and esteem your faith in every footstep. Please know that it is worth it then, now, and forever… Yours is the work of salvation, and therefore you will be magnified, compensated, made more than you are and better than you have ever been as you try to make honest effort, however feeble you may sometimes feel that to be… You are doing God's work. You are doing it wonderfully well. He is blessing you and He will bless you, even - no, <span style="font-style:italic;">especially</span> - when your days and your nights may be the most challenging."		</p>

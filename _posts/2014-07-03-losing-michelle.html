<p>To say that the Bird family has been going through some difficult times is an understatement. We lost Randy at the end of March and then only to lose the youngest sibling, Michelle, on June 4th. </p>
<p>Back about last summer, Michelle had been having really bad headaches. The doctors finally found a cyst in her brain that was blocking fluid in her brain from draining and building pressure. That was what was causing the headaches. The doctors did surgery right away when they found out. Because of the surgery, she had shunts put in to help drain the fluid and she also lost her short term memory. She did rehab to help with that. Then about a little over a month ago, her husband Scot when to work and she was sleeping. When he got home, she was in the same position as he left her. She was unconscious. He called the ambulance. There was blockage in her shunts. They went in to do surgery on that to unblock it. </p>
<p>Then a few weeks later she was back in the hospital. After a scan they saw she had cancer in her ventricles that wasn't there before. They decided to do radiation. She was staying at the hospital. Then one day her shunts got blacked again and when they went in to do surgery the saw that her ventricles were swollen and she started hemorrhaging. She went into a coma and put on life-support. That was when Cyndi received the call from Scot.  </p>
<p>Cyndi was staying with us at the time. Nate was in San Francisco for WWDC. Cyndi was going to stay with us until Thursday while Nate was gone. But Cyndi got the phone call Tuesday afternoon and we had her on a plane that evening. Then the next day they took Michelle off life support. It was the twin's birthday. </p>
<p>Cannot believe that just two months after losing their dad, they lose their little sister too. It has been crazy. Nate went straight from San Fran to Utah for Michelle's viewing and graveside service. 		</p>

<p>This week that we have been out of school for Thanksgiving break, Kenzie have been making a to do list each morning. In fact, she actually said first thing in the morning, "I need to write my to do list or else I won't know what to do today." Nate saw her to do list and laughed. She is exactly like her mother. That's what I do each day. I really can't function without a list telling me what I need to get done that day.		</p>

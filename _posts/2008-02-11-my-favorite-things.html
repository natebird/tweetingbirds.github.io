				Since Oprah comes up with her list of favorite things almost every year around Christmas time, I decided I'll come up with my list of favorite things. Just don't expect me to give you the stuff on my list... I would if I had Oprah's income. I know, the first four on my list are cleaning products, that just goes to show what a germophobe, clean, organized freak I am. Click on the colored words to see the product.</p>
<p>1. <a href="http://www.glade.com/en-US/Products/Pages/GladeCandles.aspx"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Glade's new Wisp Flameless Candle</span></span></a>. It's about $10 for the candle and about $3.50 for the refills. I had coupons for it where I got 2 candles and 2 refills for $10. I decided to try it out and I love it! It keeps the house smelling good and I don't have to worry about Kenzie accidentally burning the house down or hurting herself if she touches it. It is battery powered and scent lasts over a month. With a push of a button, a flickering light comes on to make it look like a real burning candle. It automatically turns off in 3 hours or can be turned off with a second push of a button.</p>
<p>2. <span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Lysol Disinfecting Wipes.</span></span> I use the wipes to wipe off the kitchen counter, disinfect Kenzie's toys, disinfect the toys I get from thrift stores, clean bathroom counters, and clean her highchair, and anywhere else needing a wipe or cleaning. It's nice because I don't like dealing with rags. I find them to be a nesting place for germs and you have find a place to dry them without it getting in the way of the sink. The wipes make my life easier and cleaner.</p>
<p>3. <a href="http://www.dirtdevil.com/Products/productDetail.aspx?id=40033"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Dirt Devil's Kone</span></span></a>. It is decorative, slick, simple, cordless, and easy to use. A little handheld vac that helps me keep my carpet, counters, hardwood floors, and car interior clean. It has a rechargeable base that has a light. I love it because it doesn't have a cord and it is also bagless. I also love it because I got it 1/2 off from Big Lots!</p>
<p>4. <a href="http://all-laundry.com/#/products/ultra2x/stainlifter/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">3x Concentrated All Stain Lifter Liquid Laundry Detergent</span></span></a>. I spray our stained clothes (mostly Kenzie's) with Shout spray, which is good, but not great about getting all the stains out. But the All liquid detergent helps with the rest of stain lifting. It gets most of the stains out. There are still a couple stubborn ones that I am still working on.</p>
<p>5. <a href="http://www.motts.com/Products/FamilyHealthyFavorites/MottsClassicAppleSauce.aspx"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Mott's Applesauce</span></span></a>. I love it because you can purchase the all natural, no sugar added ones. No high fructose corn syrup in it! And it also comes in peach, strawberry, blueberry, and green apple. Kenzie loves all of them. I mix it with her oatmeal or cream of wheat in the mornings. Sometimes she likes to put her cereal in it to give it more of a crunch. So much like her mother who loves crunchiness in food.</p>
<p>6. <a href="http://www.jackjohnsonmusic.com/home"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">If I Had Eyes</span></span></a>. My favorite song on Jack Johnson's new CD, Sleep Through the Static. Thanks, Nate, for getting it for me for Christmas! I love all his music. I listen to it anytime I want to remember a little bit of my childhood in Hawaii, or if I want to relax and let my worries float away. Little known fact, Jack went to Kahuku High School, the same school I went in while I lived in Hawaii. And I got to interview him for a news article back in 2003. You can listen to the song on his <span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">website</span> under featured videos.</p>
<p>7. <a href="http://www.apple.com/imac/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Apple's iMac</span></span></a>. It took us two years, living without a home computer, to save up enough money for this big purchase. But it was worth every penny. We got a deal where it came with a free, through rebate, <a href="http://www.usa.canon.com/consumer/controller?act=ModelInfoAct&amp;fcategoryid=116&amp;modelid=15403"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Canon scanner, photo printer</span></a>. The iMac with Leopard is so easy to navigate. There is no tower, everything is built in the monitor to save space. It also allows me to do all my blogging.</p>
<p>8. <a href="http://pbskids.org/superwhy/index.html"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Super Why</span></span></a>. It's Kenzie's favorite show on PBS, it's also the only show I let her watch on TV. She gets TV time from 10-11 a.m. unless we are out and about, then she gets none. That's when Super Why is on TV. It has taught her some of the alphabets and many new words. One day it will also teach her how to read. She gets so into the show and talks to it like she is part of the Super Readers. It's so cute. Her favorite character is Alpha Pig who sings a really cute alphabet song. Check your <a href="http://www.pbskids.org/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">local PBS</span></a> station for show times. I am hoping to purchase the seasons of Super Why from iTunes one day.</p>
<p>9. <a href="http://www.realsimple.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Real Simple</span></span></a>. This magazine is amazing. I have been a fan since I've been married. I love it because I try to make my life as simple as possible and this magazine gives me so many ideas on how to better my life motto: simple, fashionable, functional, classy. This is the only magazine I save because I find myself referring back to past issues. The only thing I don't like about the magazine are the recipes presented by the magazine. They are fast and simple recipes, but often require ingredients I don't have and some ingredients I don't even know where to get.</p>
<p>10. <a href="http://www.mint.com/"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="font-weight: bold;"><span class="Apple-style-span" style="color: rgb(102, 102, 0);">Mint</span></span></a>. Nate is going to love me even more for putting this on my top 10 favorite things. But I do enjoy it and hope to use it even more. It's a free site that helps you keep track of your finances... all your finances. It collects data from all your accounts- bank, savings, checking, investments, credit cards, and more. And it also emails you of unusual purchases or withdrawals. It allows you to categories your purchases, even split purchases (two or more different categories in the same transaction), and make notes of your purchases. Then it puts it in a chart and keeps track of where every penny goes. It also shows you how you can save money by showing you actual prices and deals with other companies for different services such as banking, savings, cell phones, utilities, etc. It tells you where you can put your savings for higher interest rates. And it does so much more. But best of all, it's all free!		</p>

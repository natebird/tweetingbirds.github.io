<p>Today is our 8th anniversary! We have been married for 2,922 days and counting. We're not doing much to celebrate it today because the girls have their dance classes today. And we just celebrated our birthdays. Yeah, April and May are busy months for us. Anyway, here's what we've been up to the last 8 years together…</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2 states:</strong> We've lived in 2 states together - Utah and Georgia.</li>
<li><strong>9 jobs:</strong> Tiffany - Daily Universe newspaper, LDS Living magazine, Eckerd pharmacy. Nate - BYU Computer Labs, Canister, Alexander Gallo, Fleet Ventures, Astral Brands and CardioMEMS.</li>
<li><strong>3 girly girls:</strong> I think you know them already.</li>
<li><strong>10 states and 1 country:</strong> Places we have traveled together - Washington, Idaho, California, Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama, Florida, South Carolina, Kentucky, Utah, and Taiwan.</li>
<li><strong>2 apartments, 1 house:</strong> Union Square at BYU, Alexander Ridge in Georgia and our current house.</li>
<li><strong>3 years of school:</strong> We did a year together at BYU after we got married and then Nate's 2-year MBA.</li>
<li><strong>1 trip across the country:</strong> We drove from Utah to Georgia in a large U-Haul truck towing our car.</li>
<li><strong>4 vehicles:</strong> Nate's blue Toyota pickup truck in college, my Mazda Protege from college, Honda Accord and Toyota Sienna.</li>
<li><strong>Been in 6 temples together:</strong> Atlanta, Georgia; Spokane, Washington; Salt Lake City, Utah; Oakland, California; Birmingham, Alabama; Provo, Utah;</li>
<li><strong>Seen 7 temples together:</strong> Seattle, Washington; Taipei, Taiwan; Louisville, Kentucky; Boise, Idaho; Mt. Timpanogas, Utah; Rexburg, Idaho; Idaho Falls, Idaho;</li>
<li><strong>Spent almost 2 years unemployed.</strong> That was a rough time for us financially but brought us so much closer together as a couple. We learned so much those two years - mostly, to count our blessings and be grateful for everything we have.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our future together…</p>
<ul>
<li>We would like to have one more child. I would love to have another girl. Nate doesn't care the gender, he just wants a healthy baby.</li>
<li>Nate wants to eventually start his own business. That's the entrepreneur in him. He's working on one right now.</li>
<li>We would love to do a lot more traveling. Nate and I would like to go on a cruise together. We would like to go to Hawaii and NYC, both places I have lived but Nate has never been. And our dream vacations would be Italy and New Zealand.</li>
<li>We would like to get out of our current house and move into something with a bigger yard and more room for all the girly stuff.</li>
</ul>

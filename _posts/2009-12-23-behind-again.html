				<span style="font-weight: bold;">Illnesses</span><br />About a month ago, Nate began this whole sickness thing by getting a mild version of the flu. He gave it to Tiffany. Done. Then about a week later, Tiffany had a cold. Giving it to Laney who was also teething. Then Kenzie had croup. Last week, Laney ended up with an ear infection where the pressure erupted her ear drum. It leaked fluids for several days but she stopped screaming and clinging on to Tiffany all day long. This week Tiffany is back with a sore throat, fatigue and chills. And today, Nate decided he was going to start feeling sick too. We are thriving on no sleep and Tylenol here. Fun.</p>

<p><b>Projects</b><br />It's pretty bad when cleaning the house becomes a project, but it is true. I am also still working on our master bedroom with the reveal coming beginning of January. I have been playing elf making&nbsp;<a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/2009/12/kayes-sketchbook-caddy/">a present for Kenzie</a> and stocking stuffers for the girls.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Friends</b></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">We had our college friends, Jeff & Nicole, over last weekend. It was so fun having them stay with us. It's been such a long time since we had seen them. They move around quite a bit since Jeff is in the Army. Their son and Kenzie became best play buddies very quickly.</div>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;"><b>Work</b></div>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: left;">After over a year of searching and applying to jobs, Nate finally found one. It's a contract job doing programming for a start-up business in Utah. We are so glad that he had a friend who recommended Nate to the company. It really is all about networking. What is great about this job is the flexible hours. He can work as many hours as he wants and whatever hours that best fits his schedule. Such a blessing since Nate is still in school. On top of this job, Nate has also been contacted by a few others who want him to re-branding and re-design of their websites. To say the least, he is busy. But in a good way.</div>

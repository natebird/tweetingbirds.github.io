				The month of March, I took a 4 week photo 102 class from Nicole Gerulat. I love her photography work and she has worked for big name magazines and ads and other big time clients. Her Photo 101 book was what got me to really understand shooting in manual. I also took a short class from her previously about how to photograph children of all ages. At the end of last year, she had a sale on her classes and I was able to sign up for the first session of her new Photo 102 class. </p>
<p>Do to problems on their end, I wasn't able to take the class in March as I had signed up for. So it got postponed to April. April is never a good month for me, but I wanted to take the class ASAP. I couldn't get started on the class until after we got back from our Utah/Idaho trip. </p>
<p>I have always loved photography and always wanted to learn how to really use a camera. I do not inspire to be a working photographer. I just do it for hobby. So I was excited to take this class as it will help me enhance my skill. Photography is a tricky thing now a days because DSLRs are at such a reasonable price that anyone can purchase one. And many who have one think they are an automatic photographer and their pictures will be amazing with this new camera. But they never took the time to really learn the art of photography and how to even really use their camera (manual settings, lighting, compositions, etc.). They just rely on editing tools to make their pictures look better. I want to learn the art of photography. I want to know everything about it so I can be in control of my pictures. That's why I keep taking classes. </p>
<p>I loved this class. I learned about how to use my external flash better and it gave me tips and ideas on creating a portfolio. Peaked an interest in maybe doing it as a side businessâ€¦ maybe. At least it got me thinking. We'll see how it goes. 		</p>

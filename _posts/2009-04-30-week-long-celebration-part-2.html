<p>Red Robins offers a free meal on your birthday. And since Nate and mine birthdays are so close together, we both got a free meal at Red Robins. But the nearest Red Robin from our house was about 40 minutes away. It was worth the trip for the guacamole bacon burger.</p>
<p>On Monday, we decided to go to Red Robins for lunch. We packed up both kiddos and headed off to an enjoyable outing with the family. We don't ever go out to eat, so this was a real treat. Well, on the way there, <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/04/are-we-there-yet/">Kenzie wouldn't stop talking</a>. And on the way back, we had to stop <a href="http://www.tweetingbirds.com/2009/04/trust-me/">three times</a> (twice for potty breaks and once for nursing break). What was supposed to have been a 2 hour trip took twice as long. We were beat by the time we got home.</p>

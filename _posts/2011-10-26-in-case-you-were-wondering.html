				I will get back to a regular blogging schedule one of these days. It has been crazy around here. I know. I say that every time I go on a blogging hiatus. But I'm so behind on everything that I need to catch up!</p>
<p>Let's just say we were free of illnesses for about two weeks. Then I came down with mastitis<em> again</em>! That was rough. It happened Monday night. Lai Lai started sleeping 8-9 hours at night starting Sunday night. Monday was so crazy busy that I didn't noticed that I was getting chills until that night. Then I got feverish and it was the fun mastitis again. Tuesday went like this…</p>
<p><strong>5 a.m.</strong> Lai Laiwoke up to nurse after sleeping for 8 hours straight. I broke the fever twice over the night.</p>
<p><strong>5:30 a.m.</strong> Finished nursing. Put her back down to sleep. I was still so tired that I went back to bed for another 30 minutes. Yeah. Every minute counts here.</p>
<p><strong>6 a.m.</strong> Woke up to get ready for the day. And Laney is also awake an in our room. My body aches and I am still not feeling good.</p>
<p><strong>6:30 a.m.</strong> Get Kenzie up and both girls ready for the day. Nate noticed that I wasn't feeling well so he emails his boss to see if he can work from home today.</p>
<p><strong>7:10 a.m.</strong> I start getting the chills again with another fever. Nate offered to take Kenzie to school. I snuggled under 2 thick blankets because I'm freezing. Took an ibuprofen to help with the pain and fevers. Then fell back asleep.</p>
<p><strong>8:30 a.m.</strong> Get Laney ready for dance class. It's Halloween dress up day. I nursed Lai Lai</p>
<p><strong>9:05 a.m.</strong> Laney, Lai Laiand I head out the door to dance class.</p>
<p><strong>9:30 a.m.</strong> Laney has dance class and I called the OB to see if they can call me in a Rx for the mastitis. Since this was the second time I got mastitis in the past 3 weeks, the doctor wanted me to come in to be seen.</p>
<p><strong>10:10 a.m.</strong> Leave dance class. Go to the bank. Then to the pediatrician's office for Lai Lai's 2 month checkup.</p>
<p><strong>10:30 a.m.</strong> Made it to Lai Lai's checkup. Laney is hungry so I feed her snacks. During the checkup, Lai Lai peed all over the place while I was getting her undressed for her weight and height. When I put her diaper back on, she pooped. So I used the last diaper I had for her. I nursed her while we waiting in the private room for the doctor. She pooped again after I nursed her. But this was a big one and started leaking. I didn't have any more diapers on me, I had more in the car. But I couldn't leave the office to get the diapers in the car. So she sat in a leaky poopy diaper for a while. The doctor came in to check her. Then the nurses came in to give her immunization shots (3 shots and 1 oral). When they gave her the oral immunization, she gagged and puked all over the place. The nurse gave me a #4 size diaper to change her into (she only had size 1 or size 4).</p>
<p><strong>12:00 p.m.</strong> Got home from the pediatricians. Ate lunch and switched cars in case I didn't get back from my OB appointment in time then Nate can pick up Kenzie from school.</p>
<p><strong>12:20 p.m.</strong> Went to Wal-Mart to pick up something I had ordered online. It turned out to be the wrong Wal-Mart so I didn't pick anything up.</p>
<p><strong>1:15 p.m.</strong> I had my OB visit to have my mastitis checked. The doctor didn't' say anything I didn't already know. He just gave me an Rx and called it good. Dropped the Rx off on my way home.</p>
<p><strong>2:15 p.m.</strong> Got home, switched cars. Picked up Kenzie from school. Went to the pharmacy to get Claritin for Kenzie and pick up my Rx.</p>
<p><strong>3:00 p.m.</strong> Came home, went through Kenzie's school stuff. Got Kenzie dressed for her dance class. And I nursed.</p>
<p><strong>3:30 p.m.</strong> Picked up Kenzie's friend for dance class. Left the other two kids at home with Nate.</p>
<p><strong>4:00 p.m.</strong> Kenzie's dance class.</p>
<p><strong>6:00 p.m.</strong> Got home to eat a quick dinner. Nate was so great in having dinner ready for us when we got home. And I nursed.</p>
<p><strong>6:30 p.m.</strong> Nate helped the girls with their bath. While I cleaned up dinner a bit and got Kenzie's stuff ready for school the next day.</p>
<p><strong>7:00 p.m.</strong> Put the kids in bed and family prayer.</p>
<p><strong>8:00 p.m.</strong> Nursed Lai Laiand put her to bed. I tried to stay up to write this post and answer a few emails.</p>
<p><strong>9:00 p.m.</strong> I couldn't keep my eyes open any more. Went to bed.</p>

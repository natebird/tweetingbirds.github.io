<div style="text-align: justify;">Last past couple Sundays has been interesting as the sacrament was being passed in sacrament meeting at church. Last Sunday Kenzie took a cup of sacrament water and rather than drank the water, she loudly blew bubbles with the water. She wanted the little plastic cup, but we didn't want to give it to her with water in it, so we tried to get her to drink the water. She had no interest in drinking the water, just blowing bubble... very loudly.</div>
<div style="text-align: justify;"></div>
<div style="text-align: justify;">Then yesterday, Kenzie played with some of her stickers during the passing of the sacrament, one of the stickers being a Santa Clause. I had been working with her the previous day teaching her Santa said, "Ho! Ho! Ho!" She remembered and yelled out, "Ho! Ho! Ho!" during the silence of the sacrament. She kept yelling out Santa's laughter loudly and laughing because we started laughing. She also took the sacrament cup and gave her stuffed snowman (her new favorite toy), and her Hello Kitty toys a drink by making loud slurping sounds.</div>

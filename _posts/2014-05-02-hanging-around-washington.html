				It took Randy a few days to pass away after we got there. So we had some family time. All eight Bird children were home with spouse (and 1 fianceé) except one who couldn't make it. And 11 of 12 grandchildren were also there. We were all sleeping in the same house along with Grandma Bird. And Grandma and Grandpa Roos slept at a neighbor's house but came over hang out at the house during the day. All in all, there were 30 people there during the day. All in one house. We went through about a gallon and half of milk per day. Nate and I made Costco runs just about every day to refill on produce, paper ware, and other stuff here and there.</p>
<p>The thing was the ward there provided dinners for all of us for the entire time we were there. It was incredible to see the service provided by friends and people in the ward. And it wasn't just casseroles every night. There were desserts galore and side dishes. We had more cookies and cakes than a bakery. One night people brought over three cakes. One of their friends even brought over an extra fridge that we used to keep all the food brought to us. So we had four refrigerators and one deep freeze going to hold all the food we were eating. It was hilarious! I felt like I was on a cruise with the endless amount of food. I gained so much weight the two weeks I was there, I'm sure.</p>
<p>People were begging for ways to help. They offered their homes to house people. They offered to watch our children. They brought activities to entertain the children. The people were incredible and so kind.</p>
<p>Because our girls are the oldest cousins (the next oldest cousins were 3 years old), they didn't have a whole lot of kids to play with. And then the aunties and uncles they were playing with were all sick, germs being passed around the house. Luckily we didn't get sick while we were there. I was really worried about me getting sick and then Nora getting sick. So we tried to get the girls out each day doing something - running errands, go to the park, go for walks around the neighborhood.</p>
<p>A fun fact: When we came back, Nora, was 6 weeks old. She had spent a third of her life in Washington.</p>
<p>Nate had a few of his high school friends over. And we had dinner at his friend's house too.</p>

<p>I met up with one of my long time friends, JiHye. We've been friends since I was in 3rd grade and she was in 2nd.</p>

<p>While Randy was alive, Cyndi was mostly upstairs with him. She came downstairs every once in a while. The girls loved being at grandma and grandpa's house.</p>

<p>We went for walks around the neighborhood and to their neighbor's house who had a bunny, cats, dog, and horses.</p>

<p>Nate put in some swings in the backyard play set for the kids to swing. Lai Lai loves swings and wouldn't let it go.</p>

<p>Tummy time for Nora. She actually lifted her head up pretty high.</p>

<p>When the extended family got there, the girls had a great time with Uncle Robert who pushed them around in a wheel barrel.</p>

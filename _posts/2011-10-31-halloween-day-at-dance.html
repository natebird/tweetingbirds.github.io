<p>The girls got to dress up in their Halloween costume for dance class. It was so adorable to see all the little girls dressed up in their costumes.</p>
<p>This year Laney wanted to be Buzz Lightyear. Kenzie couldn't make up her mind so I made her stick with a cowgirl. I thought cowgirl would be cute since her kindergarten classroom is a cowboy/cowgirl theme and she likes Jessie from Toy Story. And I planned on Lai Lai wearing a chicken costume that Laney wore two years ago. It turned to be a Toy Story 2 theme - Laney as Buzz, Kenzie as Jessie and Lai Lai as Al the Chicken Man from Al's Toy Barn.</p>

<p>So looking at the cost of costumes, it was crazy expensive from the Disney Store. Even the "cheap" ones from Wal-Mart were still $20 for a printed Buzz Lightyear jumpsuit without wings in cheap material. And the Jessie costume was $35 for shirt and pants, $25 for the hat and $25 for shoes. Um yeah. I'm not spending that kind of money for a Halloween costume that will only be worn once a year (because I was already spending more than that for their dance recital costumes that will only be worn once a year).</p>
<p>I decided I would make the Jessie costume. I bought a pair of jeans at Goodwill for $3, a white button up shirt for $2, fabric and tassels for $8 and a red cowgirl hat for $6. It was also fun for me to figure out how to put it together. It worked out pretty well. We ended up borrowing Buzz Lightyear from a friend who had a son who was Buzz last year. It was the nice costume from the Disney Store. Laney loved it! Buzz is her favorite character from Toy Story.</p>
<p>Side note: As mentioned before, this year having 2 girls in dance class means big cost for us. Kenzie is in a class where she is learning ballet, tap and hip-hop. She will be doing 3 numbers at the recital, one for each genre. Her costumes cost $110 and Laney's was $50. Yeah, we just spent $160 on dance costumes that will only be worn once. I told Nate that this is like buying a prom dress! Crazy.</p>

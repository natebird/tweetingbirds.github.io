				Yes, I'm sick. I think it's a little flu, without the congestion. Nate had it over the weekend and now I have it. We hope to keep it between the two of us and none of the kids. It's not fun being sick, especially when you are the mom. But I am so lucky to have Nate. He took care of me, the kids, and everything today. He stayed home from school and told me to stay in bed. He said I did an OK job of not doing anything today. I just couldn't lay there and do nothing all day. I had to do something. I did get a lot of rest though.</p>
<p>Thank you, amazing Nate. I love him to pieces!		</p>

				Kenzie has been grabbing Laney by the neck to get her away from stuff or to get her to go where she wants her to go. Laney doesn't like that. And it hurts her sometimes. We've been trying to find a way to get Kenzie to stop doing that.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Kenzie, did you just grabbed Laney by the neck?<br />Kenzie: Yes.<br />Tiffany: Are you supposed to do that?<br />Kenzie: No.<br />Tiffany: So does that mean we need to take away your princess movies?<br />Kenzie: Sure, mom. Go ahead and take it. Do you want to take my princesses too?</p>
<p>Dang. It's not working. Time out doesn't work. Taking away her toys doesn't work. Taking away movies doesn't work. She's too content and easy going. Nothing phases her. Suggestions?		</p>

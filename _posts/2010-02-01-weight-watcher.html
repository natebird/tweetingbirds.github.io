				In the car on the ride home from church around 12:30 p.m. Kenzie handed me the rest of her snacks when she was done. I munched on her leftover Goldfish crackers.</p>
<p>Kenzie: Mom, stop eating all the Goldfish.<br />Tiffany: But I'm hungry.<br />Kenzie: But Puo Puo said you'll get fat if you eat too many Goldfish.<br />Tiffany: Great, now my mom is telling me what to do through my child.		</p>

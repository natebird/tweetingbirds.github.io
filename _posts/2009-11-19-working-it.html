				<b>Kenzie:</b> Oh, I forgot my blanket upstairs. I'll go get it.</p>
<p><i>Kenzie takes a couple steps then turns around and sees Tiffany about to change Laney's diaper.</i></p>
<p><b>Kenzie:</b> Um, momâ€¦ How about I change Laney's diaper and <i>you</i> go get my blanket?<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> I don't think you know how to change Laney's diaper.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> I can change Laney's diaper.<br /><b>Tiffany:</b> [notices Laney pooped out of her diaper and onto her clothes] Kenzie, you can't change this diaper because she got it on her clothes.<br /><b>Kenzie:</b> OK, then how you change Laney's diaper and then go get my blanket? And I'll sit right here and wait for you to get my blanket.</p>

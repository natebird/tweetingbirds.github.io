				Working on making the girls some spring skirts. Measured their waist and yup, they both still have the same waist size. Which also means Laney can wear Kenzie's skirts from last summer. So the other day, I tried it and yup, it worked. I grabbed Kenzie's leg warmers and put it on Laney. They are already sharing clothes.

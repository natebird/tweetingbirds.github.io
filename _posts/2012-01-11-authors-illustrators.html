				I went to the thrift store and found a bunch of children's book there. I love purchasing children's book from thrift stores, it's so much cheaper! Anyway, one of the books was "Tumble Bumble" by Felicia Bond. I was telling Nate about it.</p>
<p>Tiffany: Yeah, I got a book by Felicia Bond. I think she's the author of those "Give a Mouse a Cookie" books.</p>
<p>Kenzie: [In an instant] No. No she's not. Laura Numeroff is the author of "If You Give a Mouse a Cookie."</p>
<p>Tiffany: Oh. I guess maybe Felicia Bond is the illustrator?</p>
<p>Kenzie: Yup. Felicia Bond illustrated the book.</p>
<p>I didn't realized I would be having such intelligent conversation with my 5-year-old. She knows her stuff.		</p>

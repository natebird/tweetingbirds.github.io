				Three kids down. One more to go. Yay! I've always said it, I do not like potty training and it's the hardest thing. Lai Lai was the hardest AND easiest to train. She took the shortest amount of time. We had her wait until she was 3 months shy of turning 3 years old to train her because of all the changes and traveling we did the past few months. She was hard because for the first week she threw tantrums and cried. Refused to go sit on the potty so many times. Begged to wear diapers again. She had a few accidents, luckily only on hardwood floors rather than on the carpet. We wondered maybe she's not ready and should wait longer. But then she stopped having accidents. But that's because she was holding it pretty much all day except going to the potty only twice in over 24 hours. And then by the end of the week it just clicked for her and she was good about it. Anytime she needed to go she would tell us and go in the potty. That was it. She even woke up in the middle of the night to go. Never once peed in her "sleeping panties", pull ups that she wore only at night. She had no problems going in public restrooms either. And no accidents after that. That girl is pretty amazing.</p>

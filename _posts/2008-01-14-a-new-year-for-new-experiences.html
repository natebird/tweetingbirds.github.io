				I know this is late to be posting stuff about the New Year since we are already halfway through January. But better late than never, huh? Here are just a few things we have planned for 2008 thus far.
<div>
<ul>
<li>Nate is hoping to start school this fall for his MBA. He is currently working on the application and studying for the GMAT.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>Nate's parents, Cyndi and Randy, are planning a trip to see Kenzie sometime at the end of February or beginning of March. We can't wait! Kenzie misses her Grandma and Grandpa.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I am starting on our food storage. Never done it before. So this is our first time storing bulky stuff from the cannery and huge jugs of water. The drought here got me motivated to be more prepared for emergencies.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>My brother will return from his mission this July or August (depending on transfers). He has never met Kenzie since he left for his mission just seven days before she was born. He will be home just in time for her to turn 2.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li>I am turning a quarter century old this year! Sad! I know I should be excited because I am still "young," but I feel like I should be doing so much more with my life at this age. I'm sure a nice elaborate birthday celebration can cure my fear of turning another year older (Hint, hint, Nate). </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>And in the mist of all this, I'm sure we will end up with a trip somewhere this year. Also we hope to have more exciting experiences throughout the year.		</p>

				Last weekend was full of temple events for us. We were blessed to have participated in these temple rededication events and celebrations. And wow. What a blessing it was for us to meet President Thomas S. Monson and the other general authorities in company. Nate and I shook their hands and spoke to them in person. That is something we will never forget.</p>
<p>About three months ago, our bishop gave Nate and I the assignment as the Youth Temple Cultural Event specialists. We were the people in charge of communicating and working things out for the youth in our ward to participate in the event. I didn't think the assignment was going to be that difficult since we weren't the ones teaching the dance, music or making the costumes. We just had to coordinate and communicate information between everyone. Um, yeah. I was so wrong. It turned out to be quite a time consuming assignment on top of Nate being YM president and me my two callings (activity day leader and primary teacher). There were lots of emails, meetings, coordinating rides for everyone to all the various stake and performance practices (that was the hardest part) and making sure the other leaders had what they needed to do their part for the ward youths. I was getting phone calls and working out rides even at 11 p.m. Friday night, the day prior to the actual show. However, it was a privilege to have this assignment and to work with the youth of our ward and their parents again. Nate and I enjoyed this opportunity to be a part of the temple rededication festivities.</p>

<p>The Bishop gave us two tickets to the show. These were hot tickets because there were limited seating (4,500 seats at the Atlanta Civic Center) to split between 14 stakes in the Atlanta Temple districts. So they pretty much had enough tickets for the parents and a few leaders to attend (there were 2,500 youths participating in the performance). Our ward had 19 participating youths. We had my parents babysit so we could attend the performance on April 30. The line to get in was wrapped around the building. We even almost got our car towed trying to find parking by the Civic Center. It was all worth it having the chance to watch the youth perform and listen to the prophet speak and seeing the other general authorities with him that evening. We enjoyed watching such a wonderful program put together by the youth of the area. I was impressed by the talents and dedication the youths that evening. It was a lovely show.</p>
<p>Since we had babysitters, Nate and I made a date out of it. We went out to eat before the show and grabbed a quick Cold Stone ice cream before heading home. I love date nights with Nate.</p>

<p>Then on Sunday, Nate and I had tickets to the temple rededication at the temple. Nate and I were planning on watching the rededication at the stake center on Sunday (tickets in green). Then the Bishop called us Wednesday evening asking if we would like tickets for the rededication at the temple. Of course! Who would turn that down? Our kids weren't able to attend because they had to be 8 years old and a baptized member of the church with a recommend from the Bishop to attend. So my parents watched the kids again while we attended the temple.</p>

<p>The temple was marvelous and the spirit was so strong. We were there for the second session at noon. Later we found out it was different than the first. Wished we had watched both but we were traveling during the first session. Nate and I were seated in one of the ordinance rooms, about a wall away from President Monson in the celestial room. The talks and testimonies were so strong. I loved hearing the testimonies of all the ladies (wives of the general authorities, Sis. Dibb and Pres. Monson's secretary of 46 years).Â Also in attendance were Elder M. Russell Ballard and his wife, Sister Ann M. Dibb (General YW 2nd counselor and Pres. Monson's daughter), Elder William R. Walker and his wife (Quorum of Seventy), Elder Walter F. Gonzales and his wife (Presidency of Quorum of Seventy) and Elder Giddons (Quorum of Seventy).</p>

<p>After the rededication, Nate and I had the opportunity to meet Elder Gonzales first. Nate's brother, Matthew, is Elder Gonzales' private English tutor. That's his job, he works for the church. About 2-3 times a week Matt goes to the church headquarters to tutor him in English and help him with his talks for events such as these. So Matt told Elder Gonzales that Nate and I would be at the dedication on Sunday. And through that connection, we were able to meet him and say hi to him and his wife.</p>
<p>By this time, everyone had exited the temple and a crowd were standing at the front of the temple behind a security line waiting for the prophet to leave. But the head security guy had us wait inside the temple to say hi to Elder Gonzales. After talking to Elder Gonzales, the other general authorities came out. Since I was standing in front of the door, President Monson saw me first and shook my hand. We shook the other general authorities while President Monson talked to a couple of the other people next to us. He showed a little boy next to me how he could move his ears and talked to him about going on a mission. It was really cute. I also talked to his daughter, Sis. Dibb for a little bit about how her mother, Sis. Monson, was doing. Then President Monson turned to me again and shook my hand again. Nate was with me so he got to meet all of them too. They were on their way to the airport we got to meet them and shook their hands before they headed back to SLC. What a privilege that was.</p>

				Life has been quite chaotic here. We just take it a day at a time and handle it to the best of our abilities. Here's what we have been up to and I'll do specific posts later with picturesâ€¦</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nate working two jobs.</strong> He has his regular job with CardioMEMS and he's been doing a huge side project with Utah Olympics' website. It hasn't helped that his regular job has been super stressful as they meet deadlines, the company that will be buying out his company, and doing the second attempt at FDA approval panel that happened early October. He is at work programming for 12 hours then come home to do more programming for the Utah Olympic site. He has been stretched thin and beyond burnt out. Poor guy. Hopefully he will finish up Utah Olympic site before the holidays and be done with side jobs for this year.</li>
<li><strong>Randy's deteriorating health.</strong> Nate's dad hasn't been doing well health-wise. He is not doing chemo anymore. His abdomen fills up with fluids everyday that causes a lot of pain. He had radiation done to shrink the cancer some cancer nodes that is supposed to help with the fluids. He also had surgery done to deaden the nerve that was shooting pain everywhere. It has helped a little bit. But at this point he is on hospice at home and at peace with returning home to our Heavenly Father. It has been an emotional and mental roller coaster for all of us. About a month ago the doctors and hospice said he would last 2 weeks to 2 months. Three months at the most. They have been having family visitors who are coming to say their goodbyes. And most of the funeral is already planned. We continue to give them support and call and do what we can from afar. Trying to make last minute memories with Randy through phone calls and texts. He doesn't even have much energy for that but he does what he can. And he loves to keep in touch with his children.</li>
<li><strong>Family fun.</strong> We try to keep doing family things with the children, especially when things are crazy around here. Those are our happy moments. A break from the day-to-day craze. We went up to Ellijay to pick apples, we are going to the zoo this week, and still want to get in Tellus Museum and the dollar theater before the end of the year. The girls had been asking to play tennis so we got all the girls tennis rackets (Nate and I already had ours) and bought children tennis balls. We've been out to play twice. Would love to go out more before it gets super cold.</li>
<li><strong>Extracurricular activities.</strong> We have our usual speech therapy for Laney on Mondays, dance classes also on Mondays, piano lessons on Wednesday, and competition dance practices twice a month on Fridays or Saturdays. I also volunteer in Kenzie's class on Mondays. It keeps us running everywhere. The kids enjoy it and are doing well in them. So that's good.</li>
<li><strong>Fall cleaning.</strong> Going through all our clothes and shoes to pull out winter stuff and putting away summer stuff. Figuring out what clothes each child needs and then finding it at great prices. Going through maternity clothes for the last time (yay!). Reorganizing parts of our house. Replacing the faucets in our kitchen and bathrooms. Preparing for the holidays.</li>
<li><strong>Friends.</strong> Having craft nights with friends. Going to birthday parties for the kids. Whatever we have time for between everything else.</li>
</ul>

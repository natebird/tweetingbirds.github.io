<p>
				Ever since we went to the Peachtree Road Race family expo the girls have been wanting to play tennis. They had a little tennis demo there at the Peachtree expo. So Nate bought the girls tennis rackets in their various sizes and children tennis balls (slower bouncing ones). Nate was excited that the girls wanted to play tennis. He played tennis in high school. This was right up his alley. Nate and I already had our rackets and a ball hopper. We just had to regrip the rackets then we were good to go too. </p>
<p>We've been out a couple of times just playing around with the girls. Kenzie and Laney are more into it than Lai Lai. Lai Lai just wants to pick up the balls. Laney is actually pretty good at hitting the balls. We have been busy so we haven't been out playing as often as we wanted to because we have been busy and Nate working a lot. But hopefully this will be a mild winter so we can go out and play more. It's a great thing for us to do as a family. I love that the girls love tennis.</p>

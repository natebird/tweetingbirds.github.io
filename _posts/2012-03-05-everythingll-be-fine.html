<div>Some of you may have already heard, but I thought I would let all of you know what is going on with Nate's dad. Last week Nate's dad, Randy, called with the news that the doctors found a lemon-size tumor in his liver. With CAT scans and other x-rays they discovered two more smaller tumors in his liver and also on the lymph nodes.</div>
<div></div>
<div>He had a biopsy last Tuesday. And the results from it was not good. He has a rare form of cancer called Cholangiocarcinoma or bile duct cancer. It usually found in older men, 65+. It is inoperable and incurable. Life expectancy for someone with this cancer is usually 1-2 years. But since he is so young and in such great health, the doctors are optimistic about extending his life. They will be doing chemotherapy directly on the cancer after Nicole's wedding. They are hoping that will put the cancer in recession or even shrink it.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nate's parents feel at peace about this. I think they are handling this situation better than their kids. They are keeping an positive attitude and they are positive that they can beat this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>The family set up a website where the Bird family can share updates of Randy's doctor visits and share the many miracles they have experienced throughout this trial. Feel free to visit the site and leave comments. Nate's parents have been reading it and felt so loved and supported by friends and family. The site is <strong><a href="http://www.everythingwillbefine.com/">www.everythingwillbefine.com</a></strong>.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Nate has a sister who will be getting married in less than two weeks in the California Oakland Temple. Originally only Nate was going to it from our family. But with this recent news of his dad, we are all going now. Randy's doctor has told him that they will work whatever treatments he has to have around the wedding. All of Randy and Cyndi's 8 kids, their son/daughter-in-laws and grandchildren will be there for the wedding. They have been wanting to get all their children together and in the temple for a long time and this is finally that opportunity. This is going to be a joyous occasion in the midst of a challenging trial.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Most of you have met Randy and Cyndi. They are the most amazing in-laws anyone could ask for. I cannot say enough wonderful things about them. They are keeping the most positive frame of mind at this time. Their motto for this trial has been "faith and gratitude" because with strong faith and gratitude for the many things in their lives they know they can handle this.</div>
<div></div>
<div>Please keep Randy, Cyndi, Nate and the rest of the Bird family in your prayers.</div>

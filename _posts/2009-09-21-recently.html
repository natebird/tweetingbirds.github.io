				Busy seems to be the word that describes our lives. I know, everyone else is living a busy life too. Two weekends ago, we had a yard sale. Sold only about half our stuff, but still made over $100. That was our goal, $100, to pay for the external hard drive we needed for our computer. I was mostly worried about backing up the priceless 15,000+ pictures on our computer. We're attempting another yard sale this weekend with a friend. I hope we get rid of the rest of our stuff. If not, I'm dumping the rest at Goodwill.</p>
<p>I was also without a computer for <i>three</i> days. My computer had a bad DVD drive. Luckily, we had the warranty on it and was able to get it replaced for free. Nate took it in before school last Monday and picked it up before school on Wednesday. Both times, different sets of Apple Geniuses working at the Genius Bar assisted him with the computer. Both times, the two different sets of Geniuses were impressed with the photo I had on my desktop background (picture below). They asked who we used as our photographer. Nate was proud to say his wife took the picture. Then they proceeded to ask if I was a pro. Nope, just a hobby. Still learning.</p>

<div style="text-align: left;">I has been a lot cooler here and rainy for the last week. I think fall is settling in on us and I am loving it. I decluttered our entire house getting ready for the yard sale - attic, closets, and all. Then I spent those three computer-less days cleaning everything up and reorganizing. There are still a ton to do putting things away and organizing, but it's nice to get started on it. A good fall cleaning.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">For the past few months I have been helping my brother, Jeffrey, apply to BYU-Idaho. He got in for the winter/summer track. He actually left last week for Utah/Idaho to find a place to live and work. I have also been helping him with getting him out there. We're so proud of him and hope the best for him in finding a job.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">Young Women also keeps me busy as we are trying to plan Young Women in Excellence and end of year programs. This has been my most challenging, fulfilling, and favorite calling thus far. It sure has taught me a lot about the gospel and being spiritually fed. I absolutely love my YW, they are the most amazing girls ever. It has also taught me to share my time with my church duties. I have never been to so many church meetings until this calling. Shhhâ€¦ don't tell, but I kinda like the meetings. It's nice to know how I can help others with my calling.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">My <a href="http://www.simplymodernmom.com/">Simply Modern Mom</a> has become a little side, unpaid, part time job for me as I keep up with it and market the site. I have been marketing through mostly word of mouth and I have more than doubled my readership in the past three weeks. It's a lot of work, but a nice outlet for me. Thanks for all your support and telling your friends about SMM.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">Nate is absolutely enjoying this semester. He has a couple of really interesting classes. And his school is doing pretty well in college football. He has been revising his resume and cover letters. He is using his school's career services to find a job. Wish us luck.</div>

<div style="text-align: left;">Kids are well. Nate is good. We are all alive and happy. That's what is most important right?</div>

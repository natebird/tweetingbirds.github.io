<p>
				I've been trying to teach Laney to say "I pee peed" or "I pooped" in hopes of getting her on her way to potty training. It's the first step right? Well, yesterday was her first time saying it all on her own. Before, she would poop and I would tell her to say it. Yesterday, she pooped then said, "I pee peed." We still have to get the pee and poop right but she's learning it.		</p>

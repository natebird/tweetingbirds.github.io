				This time it's me. Yup. Got a whole 2 week break before I was given a calling. And it was exactly what I had expected it to be… I am back in the Primary. My life prior to the last 4 years in YW was in Primary. I was a teacher for the 6-year-old class then the 10-year-old class. This time, it's a little different. I am teaching Valiant 8 (the 8 turning 9-year-olds). And I am also the Activity Day Leader. So twice a month, I get the 8 to 11-year-old girls to do Faith In God activities. That will be fun.</p>
<p>I am excited to have this calling. It's a nice step down from what I was doing before. It won't take up too much of my time during the week. Which is nice since Nate is gone all the time with YM stuff.</p>
<p>I guess Relief Society was good while it lasted… a whole 2 Sundays.		</p>

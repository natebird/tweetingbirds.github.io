<p>
				Each year at Christmas time they have parents come into dance classes to observe what the girls have been learning and then they perform a Christmas song. The girls both did very well. This year I moved Laney from Tuesday classes to Monday classes so she could do dance the same time as Kenzie. This saves me from having to drive to dance twice a week to just once a week. I am just there an hour and 45 minutes for both girls' dance classes. But then Laney isn't in class with her dance friends from the last two years. She does have one friend in her new class, Carley, whom she has know for a long time now. So those two are cute together in class. Laney is doing ballet and hip hop. </p>
<p>Kenzie is in the VIVID class where they do three genres- ballet, tap, and jazz. She loves it and is in the same class as many of her friends who has been doing dance with her for the last two years. This year her class is combined with the older class so there are 7-9 year olds in the class. And then she is also doing competition dance this year with eight other girls. They are the pre-company class. She really loves competition because they just learn one song and they work on specific skills and techniques. They have extra competition practices on Fridays or Saturdays. They will be doing two competitions this year, one at the beginning of February and one in May. Luckily both fits around when the baby will be here. She is working on her splits which she almost go it. </p>

<p>
				A conversation between Kenzie and Laney on the way home from school. </p>
<p>Kenzie: Today we learned about dart frogs. They are almost extinct. </p>
<p>Laney: What does extinct mean?</p>
<p>Kenzie: That means they are gone from the earth. Like dinosaurs. </p>
<p>Laney: Like Jesus?</p>
<p>Kenzie: No, not like Jesus because he could come down any time and visit us.</p>
<p>Laney: [Yelling out loud] Hey, Jesus! Come visit us!</p>
<p>Kenzie: It doesn't work like that. You have to pray like Joseph Smith. </p>

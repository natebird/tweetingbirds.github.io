<p>
				This little 2-year-old has been having a hard time adjusting to things and just being her age and being the third child in the family. She has a rough life. She has so many people telling her what to do and how to do it. She has now a baby sister who is taking attention away from her. And she hardly has anything that is just hers. </p>
<p>She has been flighting a lot of Laney lately because they are at that stage where they get on each other's nerves and push each other's buttons. Plus Laney is having to get used to Lai Lai old enough to want to play and talks well enough to have her own option of things. The older two girls will sometimes try to exclude Lai Lai because she doesn't play like them. And the older two are used to playing with each other. Just each other. So I have to remind them to not leave a sister out. </p>
<p>In the fall things will change because Laney will start kindergarten. Lai Lai will be home by herself. I think it will work out better for her. She will enjoy time being by herself and alone with mom. And it will allow her to be the big sister and help out since she loves to be a helper. She will get lots of time with Nora, two years before she starts school. And she will appreciate her older sisters when they come home. </p>
<p>I still have to potty train her. I think I'll wait until summer. And she will start dance class this summer. She will enjoy doing that.</p>

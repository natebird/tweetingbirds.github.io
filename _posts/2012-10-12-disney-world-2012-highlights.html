<li><strong>Cyndi and Randy made it to Orlando, Florida!</strong> This trip had been in the making for a long, long time. The girls had been asking Grandma and Grandpa Bird to take them to Disney World for over a year. And they would always respond, "Sure! Let's go tomorrow!" After we found out about Randy's cancer, Nate and I asked Randy and Cyndi if they would like for us to come visit them in Washington for a week during the summer or we could actually go to Disney World together. You know what they chose. Then with the chemo treatments, things were up and down with Randy. So the girls knew Grandma and Grandpa were coming, but we also wanted to make sure they knew there was a slight chance that something might happen and they wouldn't be able to make it. Lots of prayers were said by our girls to ensure Grandma and Grandpa's safe arrival to Disney World. The trip was also perfect timing in the sense that it also got Randy and Cyndi out of the Wenatchee fires for a week.</li>
<li><strong>Playing hide-and-seek with Sleeping Beauty. </strong>We were first in line to see Princess Aurora and she was so kind to spend so much time talking to our girls. She even played hide-and-seek with them (pictures in the link). It was a dream come true for Alaina because that's her favorite princess or all time.</li>
<li><strong>Food, food, and more food.</strong> Since we went during the off season of Disney, they offered us a free dining package with our reservations. It consisted of a quick service meal (order at the counter and eat anywhere), a table service meal (a nice sit down restaurant with waiters and waitresses) and one snack a day. We ate breakfast at the hotel room with food we purchased from a nearby grocery store. And had the rest of our meals made in some amazing restaurants. Disney doesn't down play anything. Everything is top of the line. And our bellies were happy too.</li>
<li><strong>Breakfast at the Cinderella Castle.</strong> I had scheduled to have breakfast at Cinderella's Castle as a surprise for the girls. These types of special character events are booked and filled months and months in advanced. When the day came we all went to the castle in Magic Kingdom and were greeted by Cinderella herself. We took pictures with her. Then sat down for our meal, amazing breakfasts. Nate and I had the lobster crepe with spinach and a poached egg. As we ate, more princesses came to our tables to chat with the girls, sign autograph books and take pictures. We left with a magic wand and a wishing star.</li>
<li><strong>Roller coaster rides.</strong> This was Alaina's first roller coaster experience. She was a tad too short to ride the big rides, so she just went on a little Goofy's Barnstormer ride 3-4 times. Makenzie was tall enough to ride the bigger roller coasters and her favorite was the Thunder Mountain Railroad that she rode with Grandma and Grandpa. Cyndi and Randy had a blast on Space Mountain. They hair was awesome after the ride! And Nate and I were able to go on a few roller coaster rides too!</li>
<li><strong>Junie B. Jones readathon.</strong> Makenzie and Grandma Bird read 3 or 4 Junie B. Jones books in the back of the van while traveling from parks to hotel. Makenzie was so excited to share her love of Junie B. Jones books with Grandma.</li>
<li><strong>Randy's wish came true.</strong> When we had the breakfast at Cinderella's Castle with the princesses, the girls all got to wish upon a wishing star. Randy wished for a nice Southern storm. His wish came true a few times during the week we were there. Thunder and all. You know he was loving it. We were able to play in the rain and get wet a few times.</li>
<li><strong>Two BYU football games and late nights talking.</strong> We had connecting rooms so after we put the kids to bed, Nate and I went over to Randy and Cyndi's room to hang out, watch BYU loose two football games and just chat.</li>
<li><strong>Mickey balloons.</strong> At Magic Kingdom (the park with the huge Cinderella Castle) there were Disney balloon guys selling large Mickey balloons. Alaina had been begging for one. She really wanted a pink one. We usually don't get her stuff like that but she was very convincing with her begging that Nate gave in. But the balloon guy could only take cash and we didn't have any cash on us. Alaina was very sad. We went back to Magic Kingdom the next day to spend our last day there with Randy and Cyndi. At the very end of the day, Grandpa Bird bought the two older girls a Mickey balloon and surprised them with it. It was a magical moment for those two girls and they were beside themselves. The balloons barely fit in the van on the way home. But they made it home and a week later still floating high. These are high quality balloons! The girls still play with them.</li>
<li><strong>Maturing children.</strong> It seemed like the experiences we had at Disney helped our children to mature and grow up a bit. They were a little more willing to try new things. Even Lorelai seemed to have grown up more at Disney. She is expressing herself more and saying a few more words.</li>

<p>
				I think I have been tracking this pregnancy better than the last three. This first picture began at 19 weeks with the last picture being 25 weeks. I have been feeling much, much better now and more energy. I still get tired quickly, but I can last through most days without a nap. The blackouts are gone now. And I have only gotten charlie horse one time thus far. I am in between maternity pants and one pair of regular pants I can still fit into. I am thinking legging and skirts/dresses will be my friend this pregnancy. As you can see, my belly is popping and it is starting to get in the way.</p>
<p>I am so blessed that this last pregnancy is through the winter and have been the easiest. I actually have the energy to keep up with the other three girls. I'm not quite sure what we will do when the baby gets here. I haven't thought about that part yet. I haven't even started on gathering baby stuff or anything for the baby. I am planning on doing that probably after New Years. I want to get through the holidays first then do baby prep afterwards.</p>
<p>And like last child, we are having a hard time coming up with a name. I am not willing to commit to a name yet. We still have 4 months to decide.</p>

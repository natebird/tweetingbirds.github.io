<p>
				A destructive winter storm swept through last night hitting residents with heavy rain, little hail, thunder, and lightning. And at 6 a.m., I was awaken, not by the booming sound of thunder or the clinging sound of enormous rain drops hitting our house, but by the consistent beeping of the baby monitor that I had mistaken for the alarm. When the baby monitor in Kenzie's room is turned off, the receivers make beeping sounds to let you know it is turned off or you are not getting a reception. And since I am a deep sleeper, I have been known to sleep through roaring storms and even the tornado sirens. Our power had turned off around 6 a.m. Nate had already been up listening to the storm and checking the break box to make sure nothing was tripped.</p>
<p>Then Alex, another employee showed up at our house for work (because they are between offices right now so they are working out of our spare bedroom). He told us about the power poles that were knocked down by a tree just outside of our neighborhood. I didn't understand the damage until I saw it on my way out this afternoon. I wish I had gotten a picture of it. But this is the best way I can describe it...</p>
<p>It looked like lightning or the strong winds struck an innocent tree growing next to the only road leading to our neighborhood. That tree felt picked on and wasn't willing to go down alone. On its way down to the destined ground, the tree took down a power pole holding the line that fed power to all the homes in our neighborhood and the subdivision across from ours. But that wasn't damage enough for that lonely tree. It also used the domino effect to cause the next power pole to split in half. The second pole that split in half didn't fall, but it was barely standing hanging on to what fiber of its trunk it could hold on to in order to stay standing.</p>
<p>The power company was on the scene before I even got out of bed this morning (around 9:30). Yes, I slept in because I didn't have an alarm waking me up... and yes, I need an alarm to wake me up anytime before 9:30 a.m. I am not a morning person. Laugh or judge all you want.</p>
<p>Back to my original story... due to the amount of damage caused by the storm last night, 20 schools in Downtown and over 93,000 homes around the metro area was out of power today. You can imagine the power crews working hard all day long to get power back to its customers. Unfortunately for us, the crew that arrived at the scene of our power outage didn't have enough crew members, big enough trucks, or the right equipment to fix our broken poles and the power line dangling just inches above the cars passing under it as it held the top part of the first broken pole.</p>
<p>Nate and Alex walked down to talk to the workers who said they were waiting for more crew members to show up and the right trucks to replace the poles. Once the people and trucks arrive, it would be, at least, a four hour job replacing both poles and getting the power line back up. And the fact that the poles were located on the slope of a hill and we had 20-35 mph winds gusting furiously probably didn't help the hardworking crews.</p>
<p>After our little shopping trip, Kenzie and I hung out at home where it got down to 61 degrees in the house. We couldn't eat hardly anything since I didn't want to open the refrigerator to preserve our food. And once it got around 5:30 p.m., it was dark enough to start using flashlights. Kenzie and I had a shadow puppet show until Nate got home around 6 p.m. By then we were too hungry and cold to make anything for dinner under a powerless condition. So we resorted to eating dinner at the Wendy's down the street from our house and hanging out at Blockbuster next to Wendy's until around 8 p.m. It was a bit creepy driving into our subdivision with absolutely no lights in any home and no street lights... eerie for sure!</p>
<p>When we got home, the power was still out and the crews were still diligently working on the power line. So Nate and I managed to clean and touch up the house preparing for his parents' visit tomorrow using flashlights and candle light. Randy and Cyndi will be staying with us for a week visiting Kenzie, pretty much. And the next second, the power came on! It was 9:20 p.m., 15 hours and 20 minutes later a miracle happened! We were so grateful to the power crew who worked that long to get power back to us so we can sleep in a warm house tonight!</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of Kenzie at Wendy's tonight. This was her first Wendy's experience ever and she especially loves the vanilla frostie. She shared the small frostie with her mommy who was also glad Wendy's finally came out with vanilla frosties, it's not nice to discriminate against those who do not like chocolate. We weren't able to pay for her portion of the meal, so she had to clean tables and windows for her meal as shown in the first couple pictures. And the last couple pictures are all about frosties.<br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8TpYgScUtI/AAAAAAAABcY/u7lXSq_kh70/s1600-h/IMG_7431.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7431.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171514879321592530" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8TpYwScUuI/AAAAAAAABcg/2P1RCjou9ow/s1600-h/IMG_7433.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7433.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171514883616559842" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8TpZAScUvI/AAAAAAAABco/axN3KTNQubw/s1600-h/IMG_7435.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7435.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171514887911527154" /></a><br /><a onblur="try {parent.deselectBloggerImageGracefully();} catch(e) {}" href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/_nWOBqO7eSwg/R8TpZQScUwI/AAAAAAAABcw/CyOwyGxDlA0/s1600-h/IMG_7438.jpg"><img style="display:block; margin:0px auto 10px; text-align:center;cursor:pointer; cursor:hand;" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/IMG_7438.jpg" border="0" alt="" id="BLOGGER_PHOTO_ID_5171514892206494466" /></a>		</p>
